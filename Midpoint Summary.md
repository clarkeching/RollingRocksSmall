### Chapter 33: The Egyptian Revelation

Steve calls Catherine that evening. He asks: *"Could you have told us what FPP's minimum viable solution was way back at the start of the project?"*

*"Of course."*

*"Can you tell me what we should be working on next, after December?"*

*"Sure."* She rattles off the top half dozen features from memory.

As Catherine talks through her prioritized list, Steve thinks about how he explains complicated slideshows—revealing concepts bit by bit. And how **[[Ron McKnight|Ron McKnight's]]** support team builds products the same way: one change request at a time.

Ron is flexible because he keeps his List #2 (work in progress) short and never commits to List #1 work until he can reasonably do so. **Limiting work in process is very much like working in small batches.**

Then Steve sees it: a newspaper on the couch, neatly folded, headline above the fold:

> *"More Factories Close: Can Jobs Blow be Reversed?"*

He doesn't need to read the article. That's how reporters write—**most important stuff at the top, then the next most important, then the next.** It gives them and their editors huge flexibility.

Steve hangs up and rushes to find a book. Mom follows him around offering cheese and nuts. He ignores her.

*"I may take a lover. Perhaps two,"* Mom says. *"Younger men, with stamina."*

*"Uh-hum,"* Steve says, still searching.

Mom: *"What's the book called?"*

*"Made to Stick. It's got a story about the telegraph system."*

Steve climbs into the attic, dodging old PCs, a broken printer, vacuum-packed baby clothes. He finds the book.

> *"That was when I had what I would later realize was my own French Fry Revelation. Except it was probably more geographically accurate to call it my Egyptian Revelation."*

He shows Mom the page: **"There it is: the inverted pyramid."**

### Chapter 34: Three Weeks Later
**Wednesday, September 6th**

The conference room. Walls covered in printouts and sticky notes. A toy snake named **Fippy** draped across the projector.

Catherine wears a paper hat marked "CSR" (Customer Service Representative). She clicks *Finish* and they all watch the hourglass spin.

**THREE WEEKS EARLIER:**

Steve had met Craig at 5:30 AM and explained his Egyptian Revelation—the **[[Inverted Pyramid|Inverted Pyramid]]**.

In the 19th century, journalists invented a new way of writing articles. Before the telegraph, they wrote introduction-middle-conclusion: *"It was a sunny morning as the president ate breakfast. He went about his day, ending up in a theater, where he was shot..."*

But telegraph transmissions were unreliable. Twenty-word telegrams made it through safely. Three-hundred-word articles often got cut off mid-transmission. The conclusion—the most important part—would be lost.

The solution: **Invert the article. Put the most newsworthy paragraph (the "lede") first.** If transmission fails, you still have the news.

Steve presents to the team: *"We cannot deliver FPP on December 1st."*

Silence. Vrinda: *"We are on a Death March."*

Steve explains: *"I want us to invert FPP by delivering the most important paragraph first, then the next most important, and so on until we hit December 1st. Each paragraph—each small batch—must be good enough to ship."*

Gregor frowns: *"Good enough to ship?"*

*"Good enough to ship. We still won't ship until December 1st, but I want each small chunk fully tested, fully reworked, and good enough quality that we could ship it, were it time."*

Catherine pushes back: *"So you can't tell me exactly what I'll get on December 1st?"*

*"Nope. But if we don't change, it's probable you'll get nothing."*

Catherine gets it: *"We will have transmitted almost all of our article, but it won't be good enough to print?"*

Steve nods.

The team replans. Catherine takes control of the wall of sticky notes—rearranging, crumpling, replacing. She realizes she can defer some features until after go-live. Steve's only contribution is asking *"That would be good enough to ship, right?"* every so often.

They settle on a tiny first chunk—the tip of the iceberg—estimated at one to two weeks.

**Three weeks later** (the messaging system blew up—they had to fly in experts from Australia), they finally deliver that first chunk.
