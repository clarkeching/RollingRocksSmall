# Rolling Rocks Downhill — Story Overview

> A business novel about delivering an "impossible" software project by learning that quality and speed aren't trade-offs.

---

## The Shape of the Story

**Core tension:** Steve Abernethy has an impossible deadline and believes (like everyone does) that quality and speed are trade-offs. The story proves they're not.

**Emotional journey:** Widower with two young daughters, Mum at home helping. He's carrying grief AND an impossible work situation. The ending isn't just "project succeeds"—it's Steve getting both career AND family. *"Fran would be proud."*

**Setting:** Watt's Bridge, Scotland (fictional). August 3rd to November 18th (~3.5 months).

## 🔑 Key Concepts (Foundational)

These are the concepts that solve the core problem. Master these and you understand the book.

### 1. Quality-Speed Trade-off (Chapters 7, 14-15)
*The false assumption everyone believes.*

Steve tells his team "this baby will be born premature" and "quality is negotiable" (Ch 7). Later, Craig draws the Evaporating Cloud and Steve sees the conflict clearly: ship poor quality fast OR ship good quality late. Craig challenges the assumption: *"Quality, done right, increases speed and productivity."* Steve doesn't believe him yet.

### 2. Evaporating Cloud (Chapters 13-15, 60)
*A thinking tool to see conflicts clearly.*

Craig teaches Steve the five-box diagram: two "hands" (conflicting choices), two "shoulders" (underlying needs), one "head" (common goal). Steve draws his FPP cloud and finally sees the real enemy—not Chaste, not Hal, but his own assumptions. In Chapter 60, Steve uses the cloud one last time to negotiate his dream job without sacrificing family time.

### 3. Dog Food Problem (Chapters 16-17)
*Eat what you serve—taste the software.*

Cheryl's cafeteria was serving terrible food until Craig made them eat their own cooking. *"No one ever tasted it before serving it."* They followed recipes but never checked if the food was good. Steve realizes his team inspects documents and code but doesn't "taste" whether the software actually works.

### 4. Late vs In-Process Inspection (Chapters 17-18)
*Build quality in, don't test it in at the end.*

Craig explains: the cafeteria moved from **late inspection** (checking food after it's cooked) to **in-process inspection** (tasting as you go). Steve pushes back—his team already does inspections. But Craig asks: *"Are you inspecting words and code, or tasting that the software acts as expected?"* Steve admits they spend 30%+ of projects in testing AND reworking.

### 5. Small Batches (Chapters 24-27, 32)
*Reduce batch size to improve quality AND flexibility.*

Craig's rule: *"Do not think about small batches."* (Of course Steve immediately thinks about them.) Cheryl explains how cooking in small batches solved both quality AND forecasting problems. Steve's insight in Chapter 32: small batches = small projects. Breaking work into smaller chunks forces customers to prioritize.

### 6. French Fry Revelation (Chapters 25-26)
*Replenish on demand instead of forecasting.*

The cafeteria's two problems: food went stale (cooked too early in big batches) and forecasting was impossible (too much soup, not enough lasagna). The solution: servers watch stock levels and shout when they need more chips. *"Replenish on demand."* Result: 30% more customers, 40% more revenue.

### 7. Inverted Pyramid (Chapters 33-34)
*Deliver the most important thing first.*

Steve sees a newspaper headline and realizes: journalists write the most important paragraph first, so if transmission fails, you still have the news. He proposes inverting FPP: deliver the most important features first, then the next most important. Each batch must be complete enough to ship.

### 8. Good Enough to Ship (Chapters 34-35, 55)
*Each batch must be complete and shippable.*

Steve's key requirement: *"Each small batch must be good enough to ship. We won't ship until December 1st, but I want each chunk fully tested, fully reworked, good enough quality that we could ship it."* By Chapter 55, Catherine realizes: *"If we were desperate, we could go live today with what we've got."* The minimum keeps shrinking because each increment is genuinely complete.

## 💰 The Financial Stakes

This is the "so what" of everything. The techniques aren't abstract—they're worth millions.

### The £4 Million Revelation (Chapter 49)
*Delivering early has massive financial impact.*

Eleanor reveals the math nobody expected to matter:
- Originally, FPP was supposed to launch summer next year
- Now they're launching December—**eight months early**
- At even a pessimistic £500K/month revenue, that's **£4 million in unexpected cash**

*"Who'd have thought that a drunken confession from a former employee would cause us to bring something like four million cash into the company?"*

### The Ultimate Stakes (Chapters 3, 59)
*Jobs and the company itself are on the line.*

From the beginning, Hal's job depends on FPP. By Chapter 59, we learn the full stakes: if Future Perfect doesn't sell well by August, **Wyx-Fin gets sold to the highest bidder.** The £4 million bought them time, but it's not enough. Everyone's jobs depend on this.

## 📌 Supporting Insights

These build on the key concepts or show them in action. Important, but secondary.

### Requirements Are Forecasts (Chapter 28)
Craig picks up the 312-page requirements folder. *"These things you call requirements—I don't think that word means what you think it means."* If they were genuinely required, how could Catherine descope them? They're predictions, not facts. *"Forecasts, by definition, will sometimes be right and sometimes wrong; otherwise we'd call them facts."*

### Overproduction & Underproduction (Chapters 25, 29)
Building features nobody needs (overproduction) vs. not building features they do need (underproduction). Steve's team built three payment methods that got descoped—work thrown away, just like Cheryl throwing away unsold food.

### Customer Hoarding (Chapters 31-32)
Customers say everything is top priority because they're forced to hoard. Small batches break this cycle by asking customers to prioritize just the next month, not the next year.

### Ron's Three-List System (Chapters 12, 33, 50)
Ron McKnight's legendary system: List #1 (backlog—long), List #2 (in progress—keep thin), List #3 (done—ever-growing). Ron's flexibility comes from keeping List #2 short. This is limiting work in process.

### Flowmasters (Chapters 37-44)
Self-appointed team coordinators who keep work moving. They emerge organically as the team transforms. Like Ron's three-list system, but for small teams.

### Bottlenecks/Constraints (Chapters 37-44)
*"An army travels at the speed of its slowest battalion."* Craig teaches Steve to identify constraints and subordinate everything else to them. The bottleneck shifts as they fix each one.

### Phase Two Actually Exists (Chapters 45-46)
For the first time ever, there's a genuine post-launch roadmap. Features get categorized: Must have for December 1st, Day Two (add in January), Demand-based (build only if needed). This proves the system works.

### Change Requests Become Reprioritization (Chapter 52)
Catherine evaporates the change request conflict: *"I am not requesting a change. I'm not even begging. I am simply reprioritizing our list."* This is how the inverted pyramid solves underproduction.

### Wrapping the Pig (Chapters 56, 60)
Mark's concept: *"A pig is just a pig until you put a ribbon on it; then it becomes a gift."* Reframe constraints as features. Steve uses this to negotiate his career deal too—the "pig" of more travel gets wrapped with "they fly to me."

### Walk Before You Run (Chapter 58)
Incremental rollout: start in one branch, learn, fix, expand. Catherine shows a photo of her nephew Hamish, 18 months old, holding onto a couch. Same principle as small batches, applied to deployment.

### You Didn't Invent It (Chapter 51)
Ron reveals: Barry Boehm wrote about incremental development in 1981. *"You inverted the pyramid, but you didn't invent it. You rediscovered it."* Humility plus validation.

### Ask for Help Earlier (Chapter 51)
Ron's wisdom after Steve says he should have thought of something earlier: *"Wrong. You should have asked for help earlier."*
