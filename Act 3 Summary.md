# Act 3: RESOLUTION (Chapters 50-61)
## "Victory on Both Fronts"

### Chapter 50: Vacation and Return

Steve takes the kids to the Canary Islands for two weeks. He reads *The Goal* and *Made to Stick*. He starts thinking about rolling out FPP's lessons to other projects.

When he returns, the team has made smart decisions:
- Only sell to existing Wyxcomb customers (cuts development work)
- Roll out to Scottish branches first (gives Catherine time for training)
- Flowmasters running their own three-list systems on whiteboards

*"On Monday morning, I got a sense of how things were going just by walking around the office."*

Then Eleanor sends an email: *"How do you really know your software is GETS, considering you haven't shipped anything yet?"*

---

### Chapter 51: Ron's Wisdom

Steve visits Ron McKnight. Ron has been doing an independent assessment for Eleanor and Norbert.

His verdict: *"They're fine."*

But Ron has a deeper revelation: **Incremental development already exists.** Barry Boehm wrote about it in 1981 in *Software Engineering Economics*.

*"You inverted the pyramid, but you didn't invent it. You rediscovered it."*

Ron and Steve figure out how to truly test GETS: **Ship FPP into production immediately.** Not for customers yet—but to shake out any hidden problems while there's still runway.

Steve: *"I should have thought to do this earlier."*

Ron: *"Wrong. You should have asked for help earlier."*

---

### Chapter 52: Catherine's Change Request

Catherine shows up with Gregor. She wants two things:
1. A web app (Steve says no—too risky)
2. The **Customer Level Income** feature—Change Request 191, rejected seventeen times

But Catherine has figured something out: *"I am not requesting a change. I'm not even begging. I am simply reprioritizing our list."*

Steve realizes she's just evaporated the change request conflict. This is how the inverted pyramid solves underproduction.

He approves it.

---

### Chapter 53: The FPP Web App

Steve visits Ron that evening. Ron suggested the web app would be "easier than most people think."

Steve's idea: Get Mark to cancel three of his less important marketing projects. Move those web developers onto a **dedicated FPP web team** using Ron's three-list system.

They plan it in forty minutes. **Drop #1**: Login, dashboard, balance. Three to five weeks.

Steve calls Mark. Mark offers to name one of his illegitimate children after Steve.

Ron asks: *"Do you know what you've just done here?"*

Steve doesn't.

*"You've inverted your first project from scratch."*

And more: *"You've inverted your projects list."*

---

### Chapter 54: The Messaging System Crisis

Norbert's 60th birthday party. Steve is in his Malmö hotel room. The messaging system won't work in production.

Phil is shouting on the video call. They need to fly in specialists from Australia.

Norbert orders **Plan B**: Rip out the new messaging system, revert to old CORETRAN technology. It's career suicide technology, but it would work.

Norbert: *"Your only priority is to ship FPP on December 1st. Nothing else matters. Nothing."*

---

### Chapter 55: Catherine's Desperation

Catherine meets Steve in Lister Square. She looks exhausted—dark rings under her eyes, hair in a ponytail.

*"My get-up-and-go has not only got up and gone, it's taken my will to live with it."*

Her problems:
1. Internal launch event on the 17th
2. Training materials for 36 branches
3. Call center ramp-up
4. Still steering development

She's drowning. *"No one ever expected you to launch on time. All that pressure you were under—it's just slid off your shoulders and landed on mine."*

She needs to pull half her BAs off development onto rollout.

And she's realized: *"If we were desperate, we could go live today with what we've got."* Her bare minimum has shrunk again.

---

### Chapter 56: Wrapping the Pig

Catherine explains Mark's concept: *"A pig is just a pig until you put a ribbon on it; then it becomes a gift."*

Their pig: They can only launch in one branch, and the product is tiny.

The ribbon: **Incremental rollout.** Start in Watt's Bridge branch, learn, fix, then expand.

Plus: A dedicated **IT pit crew** to action change requests based on real customer feedback.

Steve shakes his head twice—and a crazy idea forms. If Catherine can cope with manual systems until January... they don't need to launch the software on December 1st. They can **launch early into production**, test with real staff, and be *genuinely* ready by December.

*"I'd just taken our pig and done more than wrap ribbons around it. I'd shoved an apple in its mouth and turned it into the centerpiece of a banquet."*

---

### Chapter 57: The Internal Launch
**Friday, November 17th**

Darkness. Silence. Then: one hundred Irish tap shoes thundering.

*Tikatakaitikataktic. Tikatakaitikataktic.*

Mark Richmond in a top hat and tails. Megaphone. *"Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you—Future Perfect."*

Cheesy Wyx-Fin family advert. Mark literally snatches the application form out of the photograph on screen.

Catherine demonstrates the software—keying in Steve's **real application**. Steve is their seventeenth live customer.

*"FPP is alive and kicking two weeks ahead of schedule!"*

The room gasps. Then applause.

Eleanor jabs Steve with her elbow. Mouths the word *nice*.

---

### Chapter 58: Walk Before You Run

Hal challenges them: *"Why this timid drip-drip-drip rollout? What are you afraid of?"*

Catherine shows a photo of her nephew Hamish, eighteen months old, holding onto a couch.

**WALK BEFORE YOU RUN.**

Then a photo of a Formula One pit crew.

*"When we find something we don't like, Steve's team is primed—like the pit crew—and ready to pounce on any changes we request."*

Hal finally nods. *"Your team has done excellent work. Though, frankly, your website is pig-ugly."*

Steve smiles. Four weeks ago they didn't have a web app at all.

---

### Chapter 59: The Choice

Eleanor and Hal sit with Steve after the event clears.

Hal reveals the stakes: If Future Perfect doesn't sell well by August, **Wyx-Fin gets sold to the highest bidder.** The £4 million bought them time, but it's not enough.

Then Eleanor delivers the news: **Norbert wants Steve for a new job.** Group-wide. Helping other subsidiaries invert their projects.

*"It will require more travel."*

Steve's mouth falls open. It's the job of his dreams. Except for the travel.

But Hal and Eleanor want him to stay. Help save Wyx-Fin. Save everyone's jobs.

*"The choice is yours."*

---

### Chapter 60: Holding the Cards

Steve closes his eyes. He imagines the **[[Evaporating Cloud|Evaporating Cloud]]**—squeezes his right hand (take the job), wiggles his right shoulder (awesome career). Squeezes his left hand (stay), wiggles his left shoulder (save friends, time with family).

The pig: More travel.
The ribbon: What if they came to *him*?

He opens his eyes. *"We're negotiating right now, correct?"*

He calls Norbert on speaker.

---

### Chapter 61: Bacon and the Cards
**Saturday, November 18th**

Steve wakes hungover after the celebration disco—Guinness, Indian food, black Russians.

Alison: *"Your breath stinks, Daddy."*

Mum makes him a bacon sandwich. Soft bread, butter, salt, ketchup.

Steve tells her about the promotion. She asks about travel.

*"Does this mean your travel is going to increase?"*

*"No."*

*"No travel? How did you manage that?"*

Steve explains the deal he brokered:
1. Stay in Watt's Bridge
2. Focus on Future Perfect's success
3. Pilot the inverted pyramid approach at Wyx-Fin
4. When Norbert wants to roll it out to other subsidiaries, **they fly to Steve**

*"Hal and Eleanor get what they want. You get the job you've always wanted. Norbert gets what he wants."*

Steve watches Ashley and Alison playing in the backyard.

*"And, best of all, I get to spend more time at home, with you and the kids."*

Mum looks down at her hands. Then up.

*"Fran would be proud of you."*

---

## 😲 PIVOT: Steve wins both—career AND family. That's the real happy ending.

> *"That was the best thing anyone could ever say to me."*
