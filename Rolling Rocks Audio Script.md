# Rolling Rocks Downhill — Audio Companion

*A conversational reminder of your story, designed for listening while cycling. Approximately 25-30 minutes.*

## Opening

Alright Clarke, let's take a ride through your story. You know these characters. You invented these ideas. But it's been twenty years, and the details have faded. So let me walk you through it—the shape of the story, the pivots, and when each key concept lands.

This is Rolling Rocks Downhill. Your business novel about an "impossible" deadline that proves quality and speed aren't trade-offs.

---

## The Setup: Meet Steve

Your protagonist is Steve Abernethy. He's a widower—lost his wife Fran to a brain aneurysm two and a half years ago while they were on holiday in Rome. He's got two young daughters: Ashley, who's seven, and Alison, who's four. His mum's moved in to help raise them.

So Steve's already carrying grief when this impossible work situation lands on him.

It's August 3rd in Watt's Bridge, Scotland. Steve's jet-lagged, sitting in Luca's café at half-five in the morning doing his three-step recovery routine—espresso, bacon, work—when his best friend Phil McDermott calls. Phil shows up looking like a bald, malnourished Paul McCartney reeking of stale cigarettes.

And Phil's got news. Bad news.

At a pre-wedding pub session, Pauline—their former lead analyst who supposedly moved to Birmingham to care for her sick mother-in-law—drunkenly confessed the truth. She was poached by Chaste Group to build a no-frills version of FPP. And Chaste is launching April 1st. The same date Wyx-Fin was planning.

Except here's the kicker: Pauline doesn't know FPP is running late. Chaste will beat them to market.

"She was a friend," Phil says sadly.

---

## The Deadline Tightens

Steve's boss, Eleanor Scharlau—the CFO, all business, no small talk—summons him to her penthouse office. Halifax Gibbet, the CEO everyone calls Hal, is just storming out barking "No more excuses!"

Eleanor delivers the first blow: Hal has promised Group they'll beat Chaste. The new launch date is February 1st. Not April.

Steve protests. "He's robbed us of two months. He can't do that."

Eleanor, coldly: "He can, and—in fact—he just has."

Steve starts figuring out that Hal's job is on the line. FPP is his get-out-of-jail-free card.

---

## Craig Lally Enters

Meanwhile, Norbert Billings—the Group CIO based in Malmö, Steve's dotted-line boss—keeps pushing Steve to talk to this consultant upstairs named Craig Lally. Steve's been avoiding Craig because he helped Wyxcomb Health "outsource" their development team.

But Steve looks Craig up anyway. His job title is "Flow Master." His resume is full of buzzwords: Lean, Six Sigma, TOC. And his full name is Alistair Craig Lally.

Steve reluctantly agrees to meet for brunch the following Tuesday. But then things get worse before that meeting happens.

---

## The Team Meeting and the First Concept

Steve gathers his FPP team: Gregor the project manager—big, scary-looking, barrel-chested. Vrinda the lead analyst who doesn't mince words. Tim Phillips from testing. Catherine MacDonald, the customer rep with deliberately wild red hair.

Steve drops the bomb about Chaste stealing Pauline and the new February deadline.

Then he gives them their marching orders, and here's where your first key concept appears—even though Steve doesn't realize it's wrong yet.

He tells them: "Quality is negotiable. This baby will be born premature."

That's the false assumption right there. The assumption everyone believes. Quality and speed are trade-offs. You can have one or the other.

The whole book is going to prove that wrong.

---

## The Mutiny

The team works a brutal War Room session and produces a recovery plan. They've descoped the web app entirely. Gregor is confident: "Aggressive but achievable." He announces compulsory overtime and cancelled vacations.

But on August 16th—precisely 2:22 PM—Eleanor storms onto Steve's floor. "Where the hell is your staff? The FPP area is deserted!"

A contractor snitched. The permanent staff is at the pub. The Burns Unit.

Steve finds about forty people drinking. ABBA's Dancing Queen is playing. Vrinda confronts him: Gregor cancelled everyone's holidays again. Told people to work more overtime.

"I have children," she says. "He can shove it."

Phil adds: "None of us believe we'll make February 1st. And none of us believed we'd make the original date either."

Steve takes a gamble. He tells Phil and Vrinda—in confidence—that Hal has threatened his job.

Vrinda makes a deal. She'll get them back to work. But no compulsory overtime. And they need to descope even more.

"There is always more room to descope. Always."

---

## PIVOT ONE: Hal Burns His Boats

Steve walks out of the pub into the sunlight. Declan, the employee rep, rushes back with news: Chaste just announced they're launching February 1st.

And worse: Hal has just issued a press release announcing Wyx-Fin is launching December 1st.

December 1st. Two more months stolen.

This is your first major pivot. Hal has burned his boats. There's no going back now.

Steve heads upstairs planning to tell Hal exactly what an arsehole he is—but somewhere between the second and fourth floors, he chickens out.

Instead, he calls Norbert.

Norbert's first words: "Can you deliver FPP on December 1st?"

Steve: "No."

Norbert, coldly: "If FPP doesn't ship, Hal is gone. It will be difficult for me to protect you."

The words hit Steve like a slap. Norbert is his mentor—the one who pulled strings to transfer him to Watt's Bridge after Fran died. Now even Norbert is abandoning him.

Norbert's advice: "Talk to Lally. Beg if you have to."

---

## The Evaporating Cloud

So Steve finally meets Craig properly. Craig is late-50s, tieless, looks like a man who'd climbed a lot of mountains for pleasure and drove there in a twenty-year-old Volvo he maintained himself.

And Craig introduces the Evaporating Cloud—your thinking tool.

It's a five-box diagram. Two "hands" at the bottom representing the conflicting choices. Two "shoulders" representing the underlying needs. And one "head" at the top representing the common goal.

Steve draws his own cloud for FPP:
- One hand: Ship poor quality product on February 1st
- Other hand: Ship good quality with adequate features
- One shoulder: Product that sells well and makes us proud
- Other shoulder: Deliver according to Hal's schedule
- The head, the common goal: FPP is successful both long and short term

Steve writes it out and feels calm for the first time. "I saw the enemy. It wasn't Chaste. It wasn't Hal or Eleanor."

It was his own assumptions.

Craig nods: "That's why we draw it."

Then Craig challenges the core assumption. Most people think quality and speed are opposites. But: "Quality, done right, increases speed and productivity."

Steve doesn't believe him. Not yet.

---

## The Dog Food Problem

Craig takes Steve to the cafeteria kitchen to meet Cheryl—a thin, short, middle-aged woman who's worked there 28 years.

Three years ago, the cafeteria food was "barely fit for human consumption." They were about to be outsourced. Craig helped them turn it around.

Cheryl tells the story. Her old boss told Craig to "go screw himself" when he said the food was horrible. She didn't come back. Cheryl got her job.

Craig's condition: They had to eat the same food they served customers.

The first revelation? "No one ever tasted it before serving it."

They followed "foolproof" recipes but never checked if the food was actually good. Once they started tasting—and fixing—the food quality transformed in two weeks.

This is your Dog Food Problem. Eat what you serve. Taste the software.

Craig calls this moving from late inspection—testing at the end—to in-process inspection—building quality in as you go.

Steve pushes back. His team already does extensive inspections. They inspect requirements, design documents, code...

Craig asks: "Are you inspecting words and code, or tasting that the software acts as you expect?"

Steve admits they do both. But then spend 30% or more of every project in testing and reworking.

Cheryl whistles: "You spend thirty percent of your time fixing broken stuff?"

---

## The French Fry Revelation

Craig teaches Steve about the cafeteria's second problem: forecasting.

They had two issues:
1. Food deteriorated because they cooked it too far in advance in big batches
2. Forecasting was impossible—some days too much food, some days not enough

Two-hour-old cabbage. Overproduction—wasted food. And underproduction—lost sales. On some days they'd do both: too much soup but not enough lasagna.

The solution came from watching the chip fryers.

Unspoken rule Number One: Don't run out of chips. Rule Two: Don't serve cold chips.

The revelation: "Our serving staff keeps an eye on how many chips they've got out front, and when it gets too low, they shout out and we cook more."

Craig calls this "replenish on demand."

They switched to cooking vegetables in small batches. The first day was nuts. The second day was less nuts. Things kept getting better.

Results: 30% more customers, 40% more revenue. They saved their jobs.

Steve summarizes: "So cooking small batches not only improved your product quality, it also solved your forecasting problem."

"Exactly!" says Cheryl.

---

## Requirements Are Forecasts

Craig gives Steve homework. Draw the overproduction cloud. Review the earlier clouds. Then think about small batches.

But before Steve leaves, Craig picks up the 312-page requirements folder and weighs it.

"These things you call requirements—I don't think that word means what you think it means."

If they were genuinely required, how could Catherine descope them? They're more like requests or guesses.

"When your team wrote this document, it was in fact a forecast, nothing more than a prediction."

Steve gets defensive: "You're playing word games with me!"

Craig: "Forecasts, by definition, will sometimes be right and will sometimes be wrong; otherwise we'd call them facts."

The lesson: "You can blame yourselves when your forecasted requirements are wrong, or you can change the way you work so it matters less."

---

## Small Batches Equal Small Projects

Steve does his homework at home, doing the dishes after his mum's mushroom risotto. He works through the pros and cons of building many features versus building only high-value features.

He realizes: There's a natural priority within customers' requirements. They only say everything is top priority because they feel compelled to hoard.

"There must be a way to get our customers to prioritize. If I can do that, then I can break the vicious circle."

The next morning, Steve finds Ashley's bowl half-full of soggy cornflakes—she always takes more than she needs. Just like customers hoarding features.

He decides to stop using the word "requirements" and use "features" instead.

The insight builds: Could working in small batches be as simple as breaking a medium-sized project into a bunch of smaller projects?

"How disappointingly dull. I'd expected thunderclaps and awe, or maybe a Eureka Moment where I jumped out of my office and ran naked down the street."

But it felt right.

What if instead of asking customers to prioritize twelve months of work, they asked them to prioritize just the first month?

"Yes. Small batches would force our customers to prioritize."

Craig was right. Small batches were key. But a key is useless without someone to put it in the lock, turn it, and yank the door open.

---

## PIVOT TWO: The Inverted Pyramid

Steve calls Catherine that evening. He asks: "Could you have told us what FPP's minimum viable solution was way back at the start of the project?"

"Of course."

"Can you tell me what we should be working on next, after December?"

"Sure." She rattles off the top half dozen features from memory.

As Catherine talks, Steve thinks about how Ron McKnight's support team builds products one change request at a time. Ron is flexible because he keeps his List #2—work in progress—short and never commits to List #1 work until he can reasonably do so.

Limiting work in process is very much like working in small batches.

Then Steve sees it. A newspaper on the couch, neatly folded, headline above the fold:

"More Factories Close: Can Jobs Blow be Reversed?"

He doesn't need to read the article. That's how reporters write—most important stuff at the top, then the next most important, then the next. It gives them and their editors huge flexibility.

Steve hangs up and rushes to find a book called Made to Stick. It has a story about the telegraph system.

In the 19th century, journalists invented a new way of writing articles. Before the telegraph, they wrote introduction, middle, conclusion. But telegraph transmissions were unreliable. Long articles often got cut off. The conclusion—the most important part—would be lost.

The solution: Invert the article. Put the most newsworthy paragraph first. If transmission fails, you still have the news.

"That was when I had what I would later realize was my own French Fry Revelation. Except it was probably more geographically accurate to call it my Egyptian Revelation."

He shows his mum the page: "There it is: the inverted pyramid."

This is your midpoint pivot. The central insight of the book.

---

## Good Enough to Ship

Steve presents to his team: "We cannot deliver FPP on December 1st."

Silence. Vrinda says: "We are on a Death March."

Steve explains: "I want us to invert FPP by delivering the most important paragraph first, then the next most important, and so on until we hit December 1st."

But here's the key requirement—and this is one of your foundational concepts:

"Each paragraph—each small batch—must be good enough to ship. We still won't ship until December 1st, but I want each small chunk fully tested, fully reworked, and good enough quality that we could ship it, were it time."

Gregor frowns. "Good enough to ship?"

"Good enough to ship."

Catherine gets it: "We will have transmitted almost all of our article, but it won't be good enough to print?"

Steve nods.

The team replans. Catherine takes control, rearranging the wall of sticky notes, crumpling some, replacing others. They settle on a tiny first chunk—the tip of the iceberg—estimated at one to two weeks.

---

## First Wobbles, Then Rhythm

Three weeks later—the messaging system blew up, they had to fly in experts from Australia—they finally deliver that first chunk.

Catherine wears a paper hat marked "CUSTOMER." She verifies the software: add a customer, set up their application, watch the confirmation letter print.

"I cannot tell you how good this feels, to finally get my hands on something concrete."

But they took three weeks instead of one or two. Catherine does the math: 20% of time for 10% of scope. They need to double their speed.

Tim Phillips, the testing manager, says they will. "The first few attempts when you learn to ride a bike are always wobbly."

And he's right. The team settles into a rhythm:
- Daily flow improves
- Catherine gets skilled at real-time prioritization
- Flowmasters emerge—team coordinators who self-appoint to keep work moving
- New metrics: working software versus percentage complete
- Gregor's massive Gantt chart becomes less relevant

Craig teaches Steve about bottlenecks: "An army travels at the speed of its slowest battalion." Identify constraints and subordinate everything else to them. The bottleneck shifts as you fix each one.

---

## Phase Two Actually Exists

Catherine and Vrinda slash the scope even further. They categorize features:
- Must have for December 1st
- Day Two—can launch without, add in January
- Demand-based—build only if needed

Catherine asks: "How would you feel if we launched without the statement feature in place, but delivered it by early January?"

Steve realizes this is a genuine phase two—something that never existed before. Features get categorized. Change requests become reprioritization. Catherine evaporates the conflict: "I am not requesting a change. I'm not even begging. I am simply reprioritizing our list."

This is how the inverted pyramid solves underproduction.

---

## PIVOT THREE: The Four Million Pounds

Steve climbs Kelvin's Peak. Sits on a rock, eats a cheese baguette, thinks of nothing. Then picks up a pebble and flicks it over the edge. Watches it bounce down, down, down.

"Interesting. Gravity didn't always suck."

He calls Eleanor to tell her they'll make it. She puts him on hold. When she comes back, Hal and Mark are on the line.

Hal: "Is it true? We will ship on December 1st?"

Steve: "Yes."

Hal: "Do you have any doubts at all?"

Steve: "None."

Then Steve is alone with Eleanor again. And she reveals the financial stakes.

"I did not believe you would deliver FPP on time. Nor did Hal. Nor anyone in Group. So your good news has taken us by surprise."

She walks him through the math:
- Originally, FPP was supposed to launch in summer next year
- Now they're launching in December—eight months early
- At even a pessimistic half a million per month, that's four million pounds in unexpected cash

Steve: "Who'd have thought that a drunken confession from a former employee would cause us to bring something like four million cash into the company?"

Eleanor: "Who'd have thought, indeed. Halifax thinks it was his inspirational leadership."

This is your third pivot. The four million pound revelation. Steve finally understands what's really at stake—and what the techniques are actually worth.

---

## The Resolution

But there's still drama ahead. The messaging system crisis hits during Norbert's 60th birthday party. They need Plan B: rip out the new messaging system, revert to old technology.

Catherine is drowning. "No one ever expected you to launch on time. All that pressure you were under—it's just slid off your shoulders and landed on mine."

But she's also realized something crucial: "If we were desperate, we could go live today with what we've got." The minimum keeps shrinking because each increment is genuinely complete. That's what "good enough to ship" actually means.

Mark Richmond's concept saves them: "A pig is just a pig until you put a ribbon on it; then it becomes a gift."

The pig: They can only launch in one branch, and the product is tiny.
The ribbon: Incremental rollout. Walk before you run. Start in Watt's Bridge branch, learn, fix, then expand.

Ron McKnight points out that Steve didn't invent this. Barry Boehm wrote about incremental development in 1981. "You inverted the pyramid, but you didn't invent it. You rediscovered it."

And Ron's other wisdom: Steve says he should have thought to do something earlier. Ron corrects him: "Wrong. You should have asked for help earlier."

---

## The Internal Launch

Friday, November 17th. Darkness. Silence. Then: one hundred Irish tap shoes thundering.

Mark Richmond in a top hat and tails. Megaphone. "Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you—Future Perfect."

Catherine demonstrates the software—keying in Steve's real application. Steve is their seventeenth live customer.

"FPP is alive and kicking two weeks ahead of schedule!"

The room gasps. Then applause.

---

## PIVOT FOUR: Bacon and Holding the Cards

But there's one more thing. Eleanor and Hal sit with Steve after the event clears.

Hal reveals the ultimate stakes: If Future Perfect doesn't sell well by August, Wyx-Fin gets sold to the highest bidder. The four million bought them time, but it's not enough.

Then Eleanor delivers the news: Norbert wants Steve for a new job. Group-wide. Helping other subsidiaries invert their projects.

"It will require more travel."

Steve's mouth falls open. It's the job of his dreams. Except for the travel. And Hal and Eleanor want him to stay—help save Wyx-Fin, save everyone's jobs.

"The choice is yours."

Steve closes his eyes. He imagines the Evaporating Cloud—squeezes his right hand for taking the job, wiggles his right shoulder for awesome career. Squeezes his left hand for staying, wiggles his left shoulder for saving friends and time with family.

The pig: More travel.
The ribbon: What if they came to him?

He opens his eyes. "We're negotiating right now, correct?"

He calls Norbert on speaker.

---

## The Ending

Saturday, November 18th. Steve wakes hungover after the celebration disco—Guinness, Indian food, black Russians.

Alison says: "Your breath stinks, Daddy."

Mum makes him a bacon sandwich. Soft bread, butter, salt, ketchup.

Steve tells her about the promotion. She asks about travel.

"Does this mean your travel is going to increase?"

"No."

"No travel? How did you manage that?"

Steve explains the deal he brokered:
1. Stay in Watt's Bridge
2. Focus on Future Perfect's success
3. Pilot the inverted pyramid approach at Wyx-Fin
4. When Norbert wants to roll it out to other subsidiaries, they fly to Steve

Hal and Eleanor get what they want. Steve gets the job he's always wanted. Norbert gets what he wants.

"And, best of all, I get to spend more time at home, with you and the kids."

Mum looks down at her hands. Then up.

"Fran would be proud of you."

---

## Closing: The Key Concepts Recap

So that's your story, Clarke. Let's recap the key concepts and when they appear:

**Act 1** plants the false assumption—quality versus speed—and introduces the Evaporating Cloud as a thinking tool.

**The Dog Food Problem** appears in chapters 16-17: eat what you serve, taste the software. Move from late inspection to in-process inspection.

**The French Fry Revelation** comes in chapters 25-26: replenish on demand, cook in small batches. This solves both quality AND forecasting problems.

**Requirements are forecasts**—chapter 28. If they were genuinely required, you couldn't descope them.

**Small batches equal small projects**—chapter 32. Breaking work into smaller chunks forces customers to prioritize.

**The Inverted Pyramid** is your midpoint, chapters 33-34. Deliver the most important thing first. Each batch must be good enough to ship.

**Flowmasters, bottlenecks, constraints**—chapters 37-44. The team transformation.

**Phase two actually exists**—chapters 45-46. Change requests become reprioritization.

**The four million pound revelation**—chapter 49. Delivering eight months early has massive financial impact.

**Wrapping the pig**—chapter 56. A pig is just a pig until you put a ribbon on it.

**Walk before you run**—chapter 58. Incremental rollout. Start in one branch, learn, fix, expand.

And the final pivot: Steve uses the Evaporating Cloud one last time to negotiate his dream job without sacrificing family time.

That's Rolling Rocks Downhill. Quality and speed aren't trade-offs. Small batches, inverted pyramid, good enough to ship. And in the end, Steve wins both career AND family.

Fran would be proud.
