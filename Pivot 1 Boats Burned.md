# 😲 Pivot Point: Hal Burns His Boats

**End of Act 1 → Start of Act 2a**

---

## What Happens

Chaste announces they're launching February 1st. Hal responds with a press release announcing Wyx-Fin will launch December 1st - two months earlier than their already-impossible deadline.

> 'He's declared war against Chaste?'

This isn't just a deadline change. It's a point of no return. The press release isn't for the newspapers - it's a message. Hal has burned his boats. And Steve's too.

## Why It Matters

Before this moment, Steve was learning from Craig and Cheryl, but he didn't *need* to apply it. The situation was difficult but not desperate.

After this moment, everything changes:
- The deadline is now truly impossible
- There's no backing out - it's public
- Steve must do something radically different
- The old ways of working cannot save them

## The Shift

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Difficult deadline | Impossible deadline |
| Learning is optional | Learning is survival |
| Hope for the best | Must change everything |
