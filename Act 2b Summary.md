# Act 2b: ATTACK (Chapters 35-49)
## "Transformation Under Fire"

### Chapter 35: First Chunk Delivered

Catherine wears a paper hat marked "CUSTOMER." She verifies the first chunk of GETS software: add a customer, set up their application, watch the confirmation letter print.

*"I cannot tell you how good this feels, to finally get my hands on something concrete."*

But: They took three weeks instead of one or two. The messaging system blew up—they had to fly in experts from Australia. Catherine does the math: 20% of time for 10% of scope. They need to double their speed.

Tim Phillips (testing manager) says they will. *"The first few attempts when you learn to ride a bike are always wobbly."*

### Chapter 36: Eleanor's Visit

Eleanor visits the sixth floor for a demonstration. She ignores Steve's planned tour and marches over to **Krzysztof**, a skinny Polish analyst—"clearly the skinniest and weakest antelope."

She asks him how things are going. He tells her the truth: he hated testing at first ("monkey work"), but this new way is different. *"A bit of testing, a bit of analysis. A bit more testing, a bit more analysis."*

*"This is the first time since I've been working here that analysts, developers and testers have worked together as a team. I like that very much."*

Eleanor lets Krzy drive the software demo himself. Craig Lally appears, back from his son's wedding.

### Chapters 37-44: The Transformation

The team settles into a rhythm:
- Daily flow improves
- Catherine gets skilled at real-time prioritization
- **Flowmasters** emerge—team coordinators who self-appoint to keep work moving
- Steve realizes these are like Ron's three-list system, but for small teams
- New metrics: working software vs. percentage complete
- Gregor's massive Gantt chart becomes less relevant

Craig explains **bottlenecks**: *"An army travels at the speed of its slowest battalion."* He teaches Steve to identify constraints and subordinate everything else to them.

Phil and Tim map the workflow on whiteboards. They identify where work piles up—the bottleneck shifts as they fix each one.

### Chapters 45-46: Slicing and Dicing

Catherine and Vrinda slash the scope even further. They categorize features:
- **Must have for December 1st**
- **Day Two** (can launch without, add in January)
- **Demand-based** (build only if needed)

Catherine asks: *"How would you feel if we launched without the statement feature in place, but delivered it by early January?"*

Steve realizes this is a genuine **phase two**—something that never existed before.

They run Gregor's spreadsheet macro. The numbers work.

*"We'd made it."*

But Steve doesn't tell them yet. He wants to keep the pressure on so they keep finding improvements.

---

### Chapter 47: Kelvin's Peak

Steve climbs the cliff at Kelvin's Peak. He sits on a rock, eats a cheese baguette, and thinks of nothing.

Then he picks up a pebble and flicks it over the edge. Watches it bounce down, down, down.

*"Interesting. Gravity didn't always suck."*

He calls Eleanor to tell her they'll make it.

---

### Chapter 48: The £4 Million Call

Eleanor puts Steve on hold. He waits. A dog chases a tennis ball. An old man hobbles after it.

Finally Eleanor comes back—with Hal and Mark on the line.

Hal: *"Is it true? We will ship on December 1st?"*

Steve: *"Yes."*

Hal: *"Do you have any doubts at all?"*

Steve: *"None."*

### Chapter 49: Eleanor's Revelation

Steve is alone on the phone with Eleanor again. She reveals the financial stakes.

*"I did not believe you would deliver FPP on time. Nor did Hal. Nor anyone in Group. So your good news has taken us by surprise."*

She walks him through the math:
- Originally, FPP was supposed to launch in summer next year
- Now they're launching in December—eight months early
- At even a pessimistic £500K/month, that's **£4 million in unexpected cash**

Steve: *"Who'd have thought that a drunken confession from a former employee would cause us to bring something like four million cash into the company?"*

Eleanor: *"Who'd have thought, indeed. Halifax thinks it was his inspirational leadership."*

Steve asks if Hal is happy with him.

Eleanor laughs: *"Hal happy? What an interesting idea."*

Then she hangs up on him.

*"The seagull had pooped on me, after all."*

## 😲 PIVOT: The £4 million revelation. Steve finally understands what's really at stake.

> *"Your good news, while it is good, has taken us by surprise."*
