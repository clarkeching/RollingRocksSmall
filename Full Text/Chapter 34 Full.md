Chapter 34
==========

Wednesday, September 6th

THREE WEEKS LATER

Catherine clicked the *Finish* button and the cursor turned into an
hourglass.

Her PC desktop projected on the conference room wall.

We watched and we waited.

Ten of us sat squished around the conference table; another dozen stood
against the walls. The room looked busier, more lived in, than it had
three weeks earlier. The walls were covered in printouts, sticky notes
and drawings. More a working room now than a War Room or a meeting room.
A large fluorescent pink, green and white striped toy snake, which
Vrinda had named Fippy the Snake, had mysteriously threaded his way
across the top of the projection screen frame. His tongue cast a
silhouette on the screen.

Catherine wore a paper hat with CSR written on it in thick black pen.
CSR stood for Customer Service Representative. She would soon recruit
dozens of CSRs to work in FPP\'s call center, but that day she was
pretending to be one. She had just keyed her first customer application
form into the software, and we watched and waited for the dialog box
confirming that the transaction had completed successfully. I\'d seen it
work twice the day before, but I was still nervous. Our team\'s
confidence, my credibility, our collective future ... a lot was riding
on this thin slice of FPP software working properly.

\* \* \*

Three weeks earlier, I\'d met Craig for a very early breakfast and
explained my Egyptian Revelation---the inverted pyramid---to him in
detail. When I asked if that was what he\'d expected, he\'d shrugged and
said he knew I\'d come up with something, as long as I was desperate and
tried hard to not think about small batches. He told me to keep him in
the loop and to ask for help whenever I needed it, except for the next
three weeks while he was \"off the grid.\" I said I would, but he looked
skeptical. Which was understandable, considering how I\'d avoided his
help earlier, before I was desperate.

Later that morning, I\'d assembled Catherine and the rest of FPP\'s
leadership team in the conference room. It was my job to cause everyone
in the room (but mostly Catherine) to feel as desperate as I had. I
needed Catherine to realize that the only way she could get what she
wanted was to radically slice and dice FPP\'s features even further than
she already had.

As everyone sat, Phil smiled and leaned in close to me so no one else
could hear. \"There\'s a rumor going around that Hal had you fired.\"

I shook my head. \"Not yet.\" Then I turned to face everyone. \"We
cannot deliver FPP on December 1st.\"

Silence. I made eye contact with everyone sitting around the table, but
I couldn\'t tell if they were sad or angry or ... relieved?

Tim finally answered. \"February was a stretch. December is
impossible.\"

Vrinda said, \"We are on a Death March.\"

I nodded.

Catherine looked at me, eyebrows raised expectantly. \"But you\'re
working on a plan, right? That\'s what your phone call was about,
right?\"

\"I\'ve been working with Craig Lally, a senior TCQ consultant, over the
last few weeks\"---which was, technically true---\"and we identified a
tweak to our existing test processes that will increase our odds of
succeeding.\"

Catherine frowned. \"Increase our odds?\"

\"Honestly, I know this will make things better, but I do not know if we
will make this new date.\"

I stood and walked to the back of the room. I picked six sticky notes,
representing Catherine\'s highest priority features, from the wall. I
took the notes to Catherine and asked her to read them out loud.

When she had read them aloud for everyone, I turned to Gregor.
\"Hypothetically, how long would it take to deliver a product containing
only those six features?

Gregor reached across and took the sticky notes. He screwed up his face,
studied them, then shook his head. \"I don\'t really know.\" He gestured
around the table. \"We\'d need to plan in more detail, but it would
certainly take more than two weeks, if we got lucky. And maybe six or
seven weeks if we don\'t.\"

Catherine\'s face dropped. She started to say something, which if I\'d
been her would have been *Why then, did you say you could deliver the
entire project on February 1st when you can\'t even predict how long it
will take to deliver these six features?* But I held my hand up and
asked her to hold her fire.

I went to Gregor and took all but one of the sticky notes from him.
\"How long would it take to deliver just that one?\"

He looked miserable. \"Look, Steve, this is unfair. There\'s too much
uncertainty. Too many things we can\'t know until we try.\"

Catherine turned to Gregor, eyes glaring. Once again, I asked her to
wait just one more moment. Please.

I turned back to Gregor. \"I know that\'s unfair of me, Gregor. Tell me
though, you\'d be able to deliver it by the 1st of December?\"

\"Almost certainly.\"

I feigned surprise. \"You mean definitely, don\'t you?\"

He said, \"Well, almost definitely then.\"

This time I didn\'t hold Catherine back.

\"Why the hell, then, did you commit to us to deliver the entire project
on February 1st if you can\'t even tell me how long it will take you to
deliver that one little feature?\" She spun and looked directly at me.
\"I thought you guys were supposed to be professionals.\"

\"Professionals!\" blurted Gregor. \"You guys upstairs wouldn\'t even
know about Chaste\'s ambush if it weren\'t for Phil. How much money did
Mark promise the Future Perfect product would deliver into Hal\'s
coffers, based on being first to market? How do *you* have the nerve to
call *yourselves* professionals?\"

\"Oh right, blame us for this mess,\" spat Catherine. \"What this boils
down to is that you, Gregor, made a promise to us which we took in good
faith, and used in our forecasts. You know the difference between my
promise and your promise? My promise was to Mark Richmond and Hal
Gibbet. You\'re screwing around with my career here,\"---she took a deep
breath---\"not to mention Wyx-Fin\'s reputation and profitability.\"

It seemed like a good time to intervene. \"I made that promise,
Catherine, not Gregor. And I admit I\'ve had my fingers crossed since,
hoping I\'d make good on it. We haven\'t. I\'m sorry.\"

\"Well, I\'m sorry, too, Steven,\" said Catherine, her eyes narrowed,
\"But if you, or Gregor, or whoever is running this joint can\'t even
commit to delivering that one feature, then I\'ve got to go back to Mark
and advise to scrap the entire frigging project.\" She sat right back in
her chair, folded her arms and muttered something my mom wouldn\'t have
approved of.

To my surprise, Vrinda jumped to Gregor\'s defense. \"Gregor did not say
he couldn\'t deliver that one feature by December 1st. He said he
couldn\'t promise to with certainty. There are a few things that could
go wrong---earthquakes, fires, floods, all jump to mind---but they\'re
very unlikely to happen.\"

Phil stuck his hand up as if asking permission to speak. Really, though,
he was my plant and he was asking if it was a good time to throw in a
comment he and I had discussed before the meeting. I nodded.

\"Realistically, it is more likely that the messaging technology will
blow up in our face,\" Phil said.

The whole room turned to look at him. The word *aghast* springs to mind.
I could tell everyone was wondering why he hadn\'t ever mentioned this
before.

\"Hey, it\'s in your risk register,\" he said, seemingly surprised at
our reactions. \"It looked okay during proof-of-concept, way back when,
but it\'s never been tested. We\'re guinea pigs. We all knew that.\"

Catherine folded her arms tightly. \"So, what you\'re saying is, we
won\'t know if it\'s an issue or not until we start testing?\"

At the word *testing*, Tim stepped in. \"The project is loaded with
question marks, things we can\'t know until we test. The messaging
system is top of our list.\"

Catherine unfolded her arms. \"That\'s why we test, right?\"

\"Of course.\"

Catherine let out a deep breath. \"Here\'s my problem: I have to know if
this project has legs or not. The messaging system could kill us, and we
need empirical evidence one way or the other. So you need to start
testing it today.\"

\"You\'re right,\" I said. \"We must start testing as soon as possible.
But we need to start testing more than just the messaging system. And we
can\'t wait until the testing phase starts.\"

\"What do you mean?\"

I nodded at Phil.

He stood up, collected the six sticky notes from the table in front of
him, and then stuck them back on the wall. We all watched as he stood
and stared at the wall. After a minute or so, he picked up one of the
sticky notes.

He spoke directly to Catherine. \"We have to test this feature
eventually, and let\'s be honest, rework it. There\'s no way it\'s going
to work right the first time. Problem is, the testing phase doesn\'t
start for another few weeks.\" He took a deep breath and exhaled it
slowly. \"The good news, Catherine, is we *can* pull some specific bits
of testing forward, and start testing them now.\"

He nodded slowly to himself. \"We could start doing that tomorrow, maybe
even later today. If the testing uncovers bad news, then good! We\'ve
found it early, when there is more time to fix it. If it doesn\'t, then
even better. We go back to business as usual.\"

Gregor stood and joined Phil at the wall, which pleased me. Phil was my
accomplice, but Gregor was following his intuition. He peeled off
another sticky and said we should do the same with the feature it
represented. He said it contained nasty CORETRAN changes which weren\'t
tested yet.

Soon, everyone but me was standing at the wall. I sat back and watched
them chat for another fifteen minutes before they finally agreed to
spend the next week or so testing and reworking three of the riskier
high-value features.

The team rejoined at the table, and I asked if everyone felt better
about the project now. They looked at each other and nodded.

\"We will learn a lot about the quality of our earlier work,\" Catherine
said.

Gregor added, \"And in a week or so, we will have a far better idea of
whether we can hit December 1st or not.\"

I nodded in what I hoped was a thoughtful manner. \"Agreed. We start the
testing phase today, with those features as our first small batch. But
there\'s more to it than that. I need to tell you about the outcome of
my discussions with Craig Lally, from the TCS group.

\"My light bulb moment hit me last night as I was talking with
Catherine.\" I looked at Catherine, and she smiled. \"It wasn\'t a
classic light bulb moment like you read about other geniuses having.\"
(Perhaps implying I was a genius was a little over the top, but I felt
rather pleased with myself.) \"No apple fell on my head, no water spilt
in my bath. It was more like when you\'re catching a 6 a.m. flight and
you switch your bedroom light on to stop yourself from going back to
sleep after your alarm goes off.\"

I chuckled, genius-like.

No one laughed back.

\"So,\" I continued, \"way back in the nineteenth century, journalists
invented a new way of writing newspaper articles. It\'s called the
inverted pyramid. It allowed reporters to keep their commitments under
conditions of high uncertainty. Let me tell you their story.\"

I asked them to imagine that they were a reporter out in the Wild West
somewhere, and they\'d just gotten a hot news story that they needed to
send to their editor in New York. Before the telegraph came along,
they\'d have written their story then sent it off to the
editor---presumably by stage coach---who\'d receive it, edit it, and
then publish it. Their stories back then followed the
introduction-middle-conclusion students still use to write essays today:
*It was a sunny morning as the president ate his breakfast. He went
about his day, finishing up in a theater, where he was shot. He was
rushed to a doctor who did this, that and the other, and then he died.*

But then the telegraph arrived. Reporters could transmit their story in
hours rather than weeks, and today\'s news would feature in tomorrow\'s
newspapers. The telegraph was faster, but it was unreliable for long
messages. A twenty-word telegram made it through safely, but the
reporters found their three hundred-word articles were often only
partially transmitted before the line failed or you got kicked off the
machine by a burly military type.

I asked, \"Can you see what the problem with writing articles that way
was?\"

\"If the conclusion, that the president died, is missing then the story
loses its point. The story is only useful if it is transmitted in its
entirety,\" Catherine said.

I nodded, waited a bit, and then gave them a nudge. \"Can you see the
connection between the way they structured their articles and how FPP is
structured?\"

Again it was Catherine who answered. \"Their articles were valueless
until they were transmitted in their entirety; FPP can\'t ship---which
is when it becomes valuable---until all the testing is done. Is that
what you mean?\"

I nodded.

Tim looked down at his hands as if avoiding our eyes. \"That\'s not
strictly true, Catherine. Our current strategy is to deliver sooner by
lowering quality.\"

\"I think Craig and I have found a way to deliver sooner by increasing
our quality. By building quality in,\" I replied.

I leaned forward and rested my arms on the table. \"The reporters solved
their problem by inverting their articles. Flipping them over so the
most newsworthy paragraph, called the *lede* paragraph, was at the top,
then next most important paragraph was next, and so on.\"

Gregor tilted his head. \"So, even if their transmission was interrupted
part way through, their editors still had a useful article?\" He nodded
to himself. \"Very clever.\"

I let that sink in for a few moments. \"I want us to invert FPP by
delivering the most important paragraph first, then the next most
important paragraph, and so on until we hit December 1st. Each
paragraph---each small batch---must be good enough to ship.\"

Gregor frowned. \"Good enough to ship?\"

\"Good enough to ship. We still won\'t ship until December 1st, but I
want the code and the documentation and everything else for each small
chunk fully tested, fully reworked and good enough quality that we could
ship it, were it time.\"

Catherine didn\'t look happy. She waved her hand at the sticky-covered
wall. \"So, you\'re reneging on your promise you made at the end of the
War Room. Is this just another way of descoping?\"

\"Yes, it is a severe descoping *now*, rather than later. By the time we
leave this room, I hope to have pared the project back to just the three
stickies we selected earlier. They\'ll make up our first chunk of
good-enough-to-ship software. We will test and rework that small chunk
until it is good enough to ship, and then we will start working on the
next small chunk.\"

She shook her head. \"But you can\'t tell me exactly what I\'ll get on
December 1st?\"

\"Nope. But if we don\'t change, it\'s probable you\'ll get nothing.\"

\"We will, using your analogy, have transmitted almost all of our
article, but it won\'t be good enough to print?\"

I nodded.

Her eyebrows furrowed. \"Are you asking me for permission, Steve, or are
you telling me this is how it\'s going to be?\"

I looked around the table and made eye contact with each individual.
\"I\'m saying this is how it has to be.\"

\"In that case, we\'d better decide what features go in this chunk, and
then in the following ones,\" Catherine said.

Gregor said, \"Phil, Tim and I can do that, as soon as we\'re finished
here.\"

Catherine shook her head. \"No. I need to be involved in that discussion
too, Gregor.\"

He glanced at me; I shrugged. \"Umm ...why?\"

\"I\'m not getting every feature on the wall, right?\"

Gregor looked at me.

I said, \"It seems unlikely.\"

\"In that case, I must prioritize the features to ensure we get the best
possible product within the time available.\"

Gregor said, \"You\'ve already prioritized the stickies. I thought we\'d
tackle them in order.\"

She shook her head again. \"That doesn\'t work for me. Let me show
you.\" She went to the wall and grabbed one of the top three high-risk
features, the one that needed CORETRAN work, and stuck it on the far
right of the wall. \"This is high risk, but it\'s far lower value than
other features. I\'d rather increase my odds of having the others and
find a manual work-around for this one.\"

Catherine stepped away from the wall for a moment, then started
rearranging the sticky notes. She crumpled up one sticky and replaced it
with three others from different sides of the wall.

She turned back to me. \"We\'ve still got budget for this project until
April 1st, right, Steve?\"

\"At least.\"

\"So we can keep working this way, after we go live in December?\"

Instinctively I agreed, though I hadn\'t actually thought that far
ahead. \"It\'s your budget.\"

\"In that case,\" she said, picking up another bunch of sticky notes and
moving them to the right a bit, \"I don\'t need these until shortly
after we go live.\"

\"Great,\" I said, though I still felt nervous. We were sailing into
uncharted territory, making this up as we went along.

The re-planning took another thirty minutes or so, and I sat back and
watched as the team restructured the sticky notes on the wall. My only
contribution was to ask *That would be good enough to ship, right?*
every so often.

In the end we settled on a tiny chunk, the tip of the iceberg, that we
figured would take between one and two weeks to finalize depending on
what ugly issues we uncovered as we went.

Three weeks later, Phil\'s concerns about our messaging system having
come true, we finally delivered our first chunk.
