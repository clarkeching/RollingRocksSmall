Chapter 43
==========

The stuff I needed to do was go away and think by myself. And get more
coffee.

I stopped by Gregor\'s desk on the way to the canteen and quickly
explained that Catherine was looking at his spreadsheet and how testing
was our bottleneck.

He nodded. \"It\'s like in that book, *The Goal*.\"

I looked at him, surprised. \"You\'ve read the book?\"

\"My MBA contained a short module on the Theory of Constraints.\"

\"Theory of Constraints?\"

\"It\'s the theory underlying the ideas in *The Goal.* The gist is that
you make a chain stronger by making its weakest link stronger.
Strengthening any other link makes the chain heavier, but not
stronger.\"

I crouched down beside him and asked, quietly, \"If you knew we needed
to go faster, Gregor, why didn\'t you mention the book?\"

He looked confused by my question at first, then indignant. \"Honestly,
Steve? That was a long time ago. Interesting book, I suppose, but it\'s
about manufacturing and I\'ve never worked in a factory. Do you really
think we can use the ideas here?\"

\"Definitely,\" I said, surprised at my own confidence. \"We\'re pretty
sure that testing is about to become our bottleneck. Phil and Tim are
meeting at 11:00 to figure out how the developers and testers can
help.\"

\"Do you want me to meet them?\"

I thought a moment. \"No, not yet. I\'d prefer you stay here and help
Catherine out with your spreadsheet, if she needs it. I\'ve no idea if
she will come up with anything, but who knows?\"

\"Okay. But let me know if you need me.\"

\"Of course.\"

I thanked him, then headed downstairs to the canteen where I mulled over
another cup of coffee, thought about rowboats, and came up with a good
idea.
