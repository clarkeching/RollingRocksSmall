Chapter 12
==========

Monday, August 7th

Monday morning at 10 a.m., Gregor announced the new plan at the FPP
team\'s weekly meeting in our building\'s basement auditorium.

No one seemed surprised.

Some, mostly the younger folk, looked happy. Probably at the unexpected
gift of some paid overtime coming up for Christmas. Most didn\'t.

I gave a little pep talk, casting Chaste Group as an unscrupulous enemy.
I doubt it worked, but I felt better.

At 11 a.m. I met Ron McKnight, my support and maintenance manager. Ron
is a grey-haired, Wyx-Fin old-timer, a curmudgeonly mix of gruff,
grumpy, dour, and a few of the other lesser-known Disney dwarfs.

We met in his office, which sat at the diagonally opposite corner of the
building to mine.

I said, \"You heard about FPP?\"

\"Of course.\"

Ron had worked within Wyx-Fin\'s software development department
forever, and he still rolled up his sleeves and got his hands dirty
whenever we had any particularly ugly technical problems. He was a very
well-informed, highly respected part of the Wyx-Fin furniture who knew
more of what was going on than I did.

He pulled out his large, battered ring-binder from his desk\'s top
drawer and sighed. \"You need me to free up space in January and early
February for CORETRAN bug fixing?\"

\"I do. And maybe November and December too.\"

He grimaced, opened his binder and flipped through few pages. He plucked
out a thick section and placed it on his desk. Each page represented a
single request to change the CORETRAN system.

He pointed to the stack. \"That\'s all the list \#1 CORETRAN work we\'ve
got lined up between now and the end of the year.\"

I nodded. Each of Ron\'s teams operated with his three-list system. List
\#1 was a long list of requests not yet started. List \#2 held the
requests currently being worked on; it was a thin list. And List \#3 was
an ever-growing list of finished requests. He\'d worked this way since
Ada Lovelace was a programmer, and although it was simplistic, he
refused to adopt anything more sophisticated---let alone digitized.

I looked at the first page, read its summary description, then flipped
through a few more pages. \"Which of these requests can we afford to
bump to next year, if we have to?\"

\"Seventeen are mandatory, and there\'ll be some serious chest thumping
if we don\'t do another thirty or forty of them. The rest ... well,
I\'ve haven\'t promised when---or if---we\'ll deliver, so I can bump
them to later next year and free up some space with no harm.

I nodded. \"We\'ll probably have to do that. Shall I smooth the waters
with the business?\"

\"No,\" he gruffed. \"They\'re my customers. They understand the nature
of CORETRAN work. They\'ll happily take what they can get, because none
of them want to get on my bad side.\"

Ron was a grumpy old fella, I thought, but he was also flexible in a
crisis.

Soon after leaving Ron, I met with Declan McGuiness, our local employee
rep and also one of my developers, and laid out our plans. It was a
courtesy call. I wasn\'t looking for his input or his permission.

Gregor and I met with Eleanor, Mark Richmond and Catherine in Eleanor\'s
office after lunch to confirm our rescue plan.

Gregor spoke with confidence, and they seemed relieved.

Mark offered his profound thanks and said he\'d buy Gregor and me a pint
sometime.

Even Eleanor, who is naturally less generous with her praise, thanked me
for my good work as she ushered Gregor, Catherine and me out of her
office.

All in all, it was a good day. We were back on track.

For now.
