Chapter 56
==========

\"So what\'s this other thing?\"

\"Consider the facts. Our launch date is fixed in stone and it\'s very
unlikely we\'ve got enough time to rollout to all of our branches. What
do we do, if that date is truly fixed?\"

\"Well, you either add capacity, which you\'ve already done, or you flex
your scope.\"

She half-smiled, half-grimaced. \"I need to invert my branch list then
rollout to the branches incrementally.\"

I stared at her. It seemed I wasn\'t the only genius on the bench.

\"Mark and I want to launch in only one branch, the Watt\'s Bridge
branch, on December 1st, then rollout to the other branches after that.
The alternative is that we go live badly in thirty-six branches, and
although we might look good for a few weeks, we\'ll soon look like
idiots.

\"There\'s a problem though.\" She twisted her head to one side and
closed one eye so that she looked like a thrush listening for worms.
\"You looked like a hero when you inverted FPP\'s feature list. But me,
if I do the same with our branch rollout, I\'ll just look like the
clumsy oaf who dropped the ball right in front of the goal. Hal would
eat Mark and me for breakfast. And I don\'t want that.\"

I sensed where she was going with this.

\"So, I need your help to help me wrap a ribbon around this pig.\"

\"Wrap a what around a what?\"

\"It\'s one of Mark\'s sayings. A pig is just a pig until you put a
ribbon on it; then it becomes a gift. It means we need to turn this pig
of a situation into a gift for Hal by wrapping a ribbon around it.\"

\"Cute. How, exactly, do you intend doing that?\"

\"First, let me share an example Mark gave me. A few years ago, Mark
bought a new router for his house that had a feature splashed all over
the front of the box called \"Automatic Network Healing.\" You know him,
he\'s a bit of a gadget man, and he thought it sounded cool. He said his
old router got its knickers in a twist every few weeks and he had to
reboot the damned thing to fix it, so he liked the idea of a router that
healed itself automatically.

\"Now, I\'m hardly the most technical of people, Steve, so let me ask
you this: Do you know how the Automatic Network Healing feature
worked?\"

I shook my head.

\"Mark said he read the instructions, and if you switch the feature on,
then the router reboots itself, automatically, at 3 a.m. every
morning.\"

It took a moment for the brilliance of the solution to sink in. That
wasn\'t the work of a developer. That was the work of a marketer. Or a
psychopath.

\"He was duped!\"

\"That\'s one way of looking at it, but look at what they did. They took
the pig---their flaky software---and turned it into a gift: a router
that does actually perform better.\"

\"Hmm. And you want to do the same with our pig? How do we do that?\"

She smiled. \"Mark and I already have a plan.\"

\"I figured,\" I said, realizing that nothing in this conversation had
happened by chance.

\"You\'re not going to believe what we came up with.\"

\"Try me.\"

And she did.

Basically, they\'d taken the positive aspects of our pig---that we would
only launch in one branch and that our product was much smaller than
we\'d ever intended---and they\'d wrapped a ribbon around it by figuring
out how to both amplify the positives and address the negatives until
they had what Hal would hopefully call a bloody good idea.

It reminded me of what Craig had done with Wyx-Health.

\"So, what you\'re saying is that, if we had a time machine and could
roll back to the start of FPP, then we should have started with a tiny
product which we launched in just one branch?\"

She blanked for a moment, as if she\'d not thought of it that way.
\"Actually, yes.\"

\"What do you need from me?\"

She answered in one breath. \"I want a dedicated FPP sub team primed and
ready, like a Formula One pit crew, to action change requests as quickly
as they can based on what we learn from launching in the branch.\"

I nodded. \"Okay. A change request team. That\'s easy enough. Is that
it?\"

\"Yes. And it\'d be nice if you could get that messaging system fixed,
too.\"

I nodded and then shook my head. I looked at my watch. I really should
be heading back. I shook my head, again.

Maybe it was because I shook my head twice, rather than just the one
time. Whatever it was, something rattled around inside my brain.
Connections were made. New neurothingies grew. And a crazy idea began
forming inside my head.

I needed to check something. \"Look, if our messaging system bug didn\'t
get fixed until, say, January, could you cope with your manual
systems?\"

Her eyes widened in alarm. \"For real or hypothetically?\"

\"Both. It\'s an unlikely scenario, but we need to consider it.\"

She shrugged. \"I hope it\'s just your imagination being remarkably
negative. We\'d build up a pile of paper applications, but we\'d cope.
We only have one branch to start with, remember. If the product turned
out to be popular then we\'d just stop the branch staff promoting it
until we were ready.\"

I smiled. \"That\'s what I thought. In that case, we cannot launch on
December 1st. There\'s too much at stake. It\'s madness.\"

\"What?\"

It took a good bit of explaining, but it turned out I\'d just taken our
pig and done more than wrap ribbons around it. I\'d also shoved an apple
in its mouth and turned it into the centerpiece of a banquet.
