Chapter 9
=========

Finally, I was home. My house looks like a fairy tale from the outside,
a two hundred-year-old stone gatehouse built into the defensive walls of
a country estate, complete with vines creeping up the wall and round
turrets. A couple of times each day, tourists who\'d driven slightly off
the beaten track would stop to take photographs. From the inside,
though, it looks much like any modern small house, although the walls
are made of stone and much thicker than normal and the doors were built
for a time when people were considerably shorter, which required a lot
of ducking from me. We\'d extended off the back of the house a few years
earlier, before the kids arrived, but you couldn\'t see the extension
from the front.

I parked my car and snuck through the front door as quietly as I could
so I could surprise the kids. I heard Scooby-Doo playing in the den at
the far end of the house (the TV series, I assumed, not the cartoon dog
himself come to life). I dropped my bag in the doorway, slipped my shoes
off, then tiptoed down the hall with my coat pockets rustling. I smiled
to myself, imagining how my two girls would react when I surprised them
with their gifts---and me. They loved surprises.

I snuck through the house then paused at the doorway, peering through
the partially open door at my family. I smiled, though I still felt a
stab of guilt at not making the time to get home sooner. Mom, elegantly
dressed, as always, had the girls fed, bathed and in their pajamas. She
was combing Alison\'s blonde hair while Ashley, the eldest, lay on the
mat with a coloring book and pile of colored pencils in front of her.
One of our fat tabby cats, Mr. Purrrrple, snuggled up beside her
cleaning his paws. Ashley\'s tongue stuck out the side of her mouth as
she concentrated.

I pushed the door open. \"Ahoy, me mateys!\"

\"Dad!\" They both rushed to me, and moments later I was covered in hugs
and they were covered in kisses. Then their minds turned to other
business.

\"Did you bring us any presents? Did you? Did you?\"

I sat the girls down and dished out the parcels. They were shiny, tacky
little things---the gifts, not the girls---but they were just the sort
of thing my two little girls loved.

It felt good to be properly home.
