Chapter 11
==========

Vrinda and I had joined Wyx-Fin on the same day from the same graduate
program. She was, in fact, only three weeks younger than me. Our first
few years in Wyx-Fin, we rotated through different jobs as we went on
what Wyxcomb Global HR called *Our Strengths Discovery*. In normal
speak, we spent a few years finding out what we were good at. On a
spectrum of thick-skinned-ness, I was at one end and she at the other.
So she specialized in analysis and I in management. As an analyst, she
removed ambiguity and uncertainty; as a manager, I figured out how to
live with them both.

We\'d been friends since meeting, and sometimes her kids and my kids
played together on the weekends. Her husband once worked in Wyx-Fin as
an actuary, but now was a moderately successful science-fiction writer.

We chatted idly as we walked to my office. *How are your kids? Fine,
yours?* That sort of thing. When we reached my office, I closed my door
and we sat.

\"Is everything okay?\"

\"Yeah,\" she said, unconvincingly.

\"Are you sure? In the meeting, you only spoke once and then, honestly,
you seemed a bit snippy. What\'s up?\"

She bit down on her upper lip, as if forcing herself to not speak, then
blurted out, \"Am I telling you this as a friend or as one of your
staff?\"

\"A bit of both, I guess.\"

\"In that case, I\'ll choose my words carefully.\" She paused a moment,
then spoke. \"That man is an arse. None of us like working for him. He
doesn\'t listen. He doesn\'t trust any of us and frankly, we do not
trust him.\"

I nodded, but said nothing. I didn\'t want to interrupt the flow. She
kept talking for a good minute before she said something that forced me
to interrupt.

\"For months, he\'s been lying about the health of the project,\" she
said.

\"Lying?\"

\"He\'s painted a nice, rosy picture of the project to you and the
steering group, but we all knew we\'d never be live in April.\"

I nodded slowly, surprised at her naivety, and looked directly in her
eyes to ensure I had her attention. \"Gregor didn\'t lie to me or to our
steering group. April was always an aggressive date.\"

She looked at me blankly. \"You knew we\'d run late?\"

\"Of course. And so did everyone on the steering group.\"

She blinked and looked at me as if I\'d just told her the Tooth Fairy
and the Easter Bunny were the same person. (They\'re not.) She was a
great analyst, but after two decades in the game, where she\'d seen
project after project run late, she still managed to be surprised when
it happened yet again.

\"So why\'d Gregor lie to us? Was it just to keep the pressure on? Is
that it? Huh? Crack the whip to keep us lazy workers from slacking
off?\"

I felt myself getting a little angry. \"Look, we wanted to ship in
April, but we knew that date was aggressive. We kept the pressure on
because if we didn\'t then we\'d have no chance of delivering early.\"

She scrunched up her lips, thinking. \"Did you ever consider that, given
no one believed the date was feasible, perhaps some folks slowed down?
No point flogging a dead horse? Especially when everyone thinks the
jockey is a jerk. Who works hard for a jerk?\"

I shrugged.

She shook her head. \"Surely there are better ways to motivate us lazy
workers?\"

Instead of answering, I asked her a question. \"Look, what would have
happened to scope if the date had been say, eight months later? December
next year rather than April? Would the scope have been bigger or
smaller?\"

She looked up, thinking, I guess. \"Bigger, of course. Catherine cut a
lot of features to fit into April.\"

\"And how about change requests? With more time up our sleeves would we
have more or less change?\"

\"More, obviously.\"

She screwed up her nose, as if she smelled something bad but couldn\'t
quite tell where it was coming from. Or maybe she could.

I said \"You know this. The scope of the project always expands until
it\'s too big to fit in the time available to deliver it. If we didn\'t
put aggressive deadlines in place we\'d never ship anything.\"

\"I suppose.\"

I was ready to wrap this up and go home to see my kids. I changed the
topic. \"You look tired.\"

\"I am,\" she said, then narrowed her gaze. \"But, you know, I don\'t
want your sympathy. I want you to fix FPP.\"

\"How?\"

Her mouth fell open. \"How should I know? That\'s your job.\"

I shook my head. \"No, that\'s not my job, that\'s Gregor\'s job. He
manages the project\'s uncertainty. And you might not like him, but he
is good at his job.\"

\"But you\'re still crossing your fingers, right?\"

\"Pardon?\"

\"Just now, in our meeting, Gregor told you the February 1st date was
\'aggressive but achievable.\' Which is how you just described the April
date. If it\'s aggressive then it\'s no slam dunk. We should expect it
to run late, right?\"

My jaw fell open just a little. I didn\'t know it at the time, but I was
experiencing a stress reaction called cognitive dissonance, which
happens when new information conflicts with one\'s established beliefs.
Basically, my brain was flummoxed. The typical response to cognitive
dissonance is not to take on the new information and try to work through
the discrepancy, but to remove that stress by ignoring or discounting
the new information. And that\'s exactly what I did.

I shrugged. I smiled. I glanced at my watch. I changed the subject.
\"Look, I\'ve barely seen the kids since I got back.\"

I said I\'d walk downstairs with her, if she liked. We did the
we-should-catch-up-sometime-with-the-kids chat as we made our way out of
the building, transitioning out of work mode and into friends and family
mode.

We both swiped out at the front of the building then stood for a moment
before we parted. Vrinda would turn right towards High Street and I
would cross the foyer, then head down to the basement garage.

I said, \"Look, I know you desperately want FPP to succeed. So do I. So
does Gregor. But he has an incredibly difficult job juggling a lot of
question marks and balancing a load of conflicting needs. I don\'t think
he\'s the ogre you think he is.\"

She shook her head. \"I never said he\'s an ogre. I said he\'s an arse,
and I implied this project is going to crash and burn.\"
