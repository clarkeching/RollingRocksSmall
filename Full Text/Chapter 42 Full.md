Chapter 42
==========

I found Catherine sitting in my office chair, a water bottle beside her,
her laptop open.

She did not look happy.

She rose out of my chair when she saw me, waving a scrunched-up sheet of
paper. \"Chaste issued a press release at close of business last
night.\"

I reclaimed my chair. \"Good morning.\"

\"I am not happy.\"

She dumped her anger on me. Chaste was now launching on December 1st.
Their product was similar to ours, but considerably smaller, despite our
descoping exercises. As far as she could tell, they didn\'t have
Catherine\'s most desired feature: customer-level income. But nor did
we, so that one was a draw. Their proposition was mostly self-service,
relying on customers looking after themselves through a web app. Our
proposition was full service, and although FPP would have some pretty
web pages, we didn\'t have a web app. We would, of course, play our full
service as a benefit, but no web app made us look weak.

\"So actually, although I\'m angry at Chaste, there are no surprises and
at least we know where we stand. We have similar offerings, but we
appeal to different markets. It\'s not all bad news.\"

\"That\'s good,\" I said, \"because I have some. Bad news, I mean.\"

She sat. She knew what was coming.

\"We\'re not even going to make December 1st, are we?\"

I shook my head and briefly described my weekend of spreadsheet hell
with Gregor.

She looked at the ceiling as she absorbed what I\'d just told her. \"But
there is a slim chance?\"

\"Yes, but too slim to count on.\"

She nodded. \"What are the chances we\'ll ship something that will stand
on its own before March?\"

\"Middling to good.\"

She said, \"Mark told me December 1st has to be a slam dunk, or
otherwise there will be consequences. He said we have to be selling FPP
to real customers on December 1st for it to count.\"

\"As it stands, we cannot do that.\"

She looked like she was in pain. \"You need to tell Eleanor and I need
to tell Mark so they can break the news to Hal.\"

I leaned forward and asked quietly, \"Can you hold off a few hours?\"

She looked at me suspiciously. \"Why?\"

\"We have an idea that might make things better.\" I explained how
testers were about to become our bottleneck and how maybe we could come
up with something to speed them up.

\"Testers?\"

\"A ten percent increase in testing capacity makes the whole project run
ten percent faster.\"

Her eyes widened. \"I\'m sure Mark can find budget to recruit more
testers.\" She reached for her mobile.

I shook my head and explained how adding new people to the project at
this late stage would almost certainly slow the project down. I added
that I was getting together with Phil and Tim later to figure out what
the whole team could do to squeeze more out of our testing.

\"Is it worth it?\" she said. \"Can we realistically speed things up
enough to hit December 1st?\"

I said, \"I doubt it,\" which was true. \"But we won\'t know until we
try. We\'d have to at least double, or triple, our current speed before
December 1st is guaranteed. I can\'t see that happening.\"

She said, \"Look, don\'t be offended by me asking this, but can I look
at the spreadsheet you and Gregor used to come up with your dates? I
trust your work, but you never know. With fresh eyes I might see
something you\'ve missed.\"

I was about to say that we\'d double-checked our work, but who was I to
stop her clutching at straws?

I made a copy of the spreadsheet which she opened on her laptop, and
then I quickly walked her through the structure. I asked her to not play
around with the macros. Gregor and I knew how to work them, but they
hadn\'t been built for sharing. I suggested she work in my office since
Gregor sat just around the corner, and he could dig her out of any
quicksand if she got bogged down in the spreadsheet. Besides, I had some
other things I needed to do. It was 8:20 a.m.
