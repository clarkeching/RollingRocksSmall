Chapter 14
==========

I picked up Craig\'s pen and reluctantly reached across and pulled the
pad close to me. \"What problem do you want me to tackle?\"

He said, \"Norbert told me about your FPP situation. How about if we
start with that?\"

I glanced at the Wyx-Health cloud and copied the stickman shape, the
boxes and the arrows. \"That was the easy bit. What next?\"

He said step one was to tell him off the top of my head, as quickly as I
could, what the problem was.

I nodded. \"I don\'t know for sure if I can deliver FPP on February
1st.\"

\"Why not write that at the top of the page.\"

I looked at his pen. It felt good and solid, well-balanced in my hand. I
concentrated as I wrote, taking extra care to write tidily.

Craig told me that step two was to fill out the D box by answering the
question *What action do I find myself complaining about?*

I played his question back silently in my head. It seemed easy enough.

But it wasn\'t. I couldn\'t quite think what to write. I hesitated, and
then confessed I wasn\'t sure.

He smiled gently. \"Are you, maybe, just a little nervous about getting
it wrong?\"

\"No. Well, yeah. A little bit.\"

\"You don\'t have to get it right the first time. Paper and ink are
cheap. Just tell me: What\'s pissing you off?\"

I bit down on the inside of my lip. I thought of all the things that
bothered me, and then decided the ONE thing that really pissed me off
was that we\'d already used our industry\'s only secret weapon: poor
quality. We were deliberately shipping a crappy product, loaded with
defects and barely fit for purpose. It sickened me, but I felt I had no
option.

I explained this to Craig, and together we hashed it. I wrote *Shipping
a poor quality, inadequately featured product on February 1st* in the D
box.

He nodded. \"Our third step is to fill in the D-prime box by answering
this question: *What is your desired, opposite action of D?*\"

With more enthusiasm this time, I wrote: *Shipping a product that is
good quality and with adequate features.*

He lifted his hands and weighed the two options, as if he were comparing
the weight of two melons. \"So, on the one hand, you ship good stuff. On
the other hand, you ship not so good stuff.\"

He put his hands down and asked me to fill out the C box by answering
*What need is satisfied by the action in D-prime?*

I said, \"Is this when I list the pros of D-prime and the cons of D,
like we did with the buy/build cloud, then use them to figure out what
goes in C?\"

\"You\'ve got it now.\"

So I listed off the benefits of shipping quality and then the negatives
of shipping poor quality. It wasn\'t difficult. Customers would like our
product, presumably buy more of it, maybe even tell their friends about
it. We\'d make more sales. Our staff would be proud. The cost to support
it, after it went live, would be far lower. We could use our staff on
other projects, rather than bug-fixing. We wouldn\'t face any big
risks---reputational or more concrete. I could have gone on, but I
didn\'t need to.

So what summed them up? Quality was quality was quality. How could I say
it in a sentence? I asked Craig to describe the C box again.

\"Figuring out B and C can sometimes be tricky. If you\'re stuck, then
try asking this question instead: *What is jeopardized by doing D?*\"

I sighed. What did that even mean?

He said, \"Imagine using the index finger on your D hand to jab yourself
firmly in the opposite shoulder, C. That finger would hurt your
shoulder. Doing D hurts or jeopardizes something. What is it?\"

I looked at the D box. What did shipping crap jeopardize?

\"Shipping crap jeopardizes the product\'s commercial viability. We
might keep Hal happy short-term, but we won\'t sell anything and we will
damage our long-term credibility.\"

Craig smiled and said, \"Can you shorten that a bit?\"

I thought a moment, then wrote *Delivering a product that sells well for
a long time and makes us proud* in the C box.

We moved to step five, completing the B box. Craig reminded me that we
started with box D, something we didn\'t like but we did anyway. Why was
that? What did I get out of doing D? Why did I put up with D?

What were the pros of shipping a poor quality product? We were more
likely to deliver on time and budget. We\'d beat Chaste to Market. Hal
would keep whatever promise he\'d made to the Group. I\'d keep my job.
And the cons of taking longer and delivering a proper product? There was
only one I could think of: FPP could take a very long time to meet the
market. I wrote *Deliver FPP according to Hal\'s schedule* in the B box.

For the last step, we filled in the A box with: *FPP is successful both
long and short term.* That seemed obvious at the time, but as I would
discover much later, it did not tell the full story. If only I\'d known
then what was really going on in Hal\'s world.

We then tweaked the wording of the cloud. Craig said, \"Read it out
loud. Start from the top and work down, like this: *In order to, A we
must B* and *In order to A, we must C* and so on.\"

I did as I was told.

He said, \"Now check that D and D-prime actually do conflict with each
other.\"

I verified they were indeed opposites, that I couldn\'t do both at the
same time.

\"Two final sanity checks,\" he said. \"Does doing D really jeopardize
C? And does doing D-prime really jeopardize B?\"

I checked, then said they did.

\"Good.\" He reached across and ripped the page out. He handed the pad
back to me and asked me to write the cloud out fresh, from memory.

I did, changing the language a little more. It took about a minute, and
afterward I felt surprisingly calm.

I saw the enemy. It wasn\'t Chaste. It wasn\'t Hal or Eleanor, and it
wasn\'t the Group.

\"We can\'t win as long as this cloud exists.\"

Craig nodded solemnly. \"That\'s why we draw it.\"
