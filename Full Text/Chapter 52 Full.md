Chapter 52
==========

Tuesday, October 17th

The following morning, Phil and I met with the manager of our local
operations team and one of her senior guys to figure out how to actually
ship rather than just potentially ship. Ninety minutes later, as I
showed them out of my office after a fraught meeting, I heard Catherine
call my name. I looked up and saw her marching toward me, a determined
look on her face. She\'d been waiting for our meeting to finish.

I hadn\'t seen much of her during the previous few weeks, partly because
I had been on vacation but also because she\'d relocated to her new call
center office across town where she was forming FPP\'s operational team.

Gregor was a few steps behind her. He didn\'t look happy. It looked like
I was about to play referee again.

I gestured them in and they sat, both with their arms firmly crossed. I
wheeled my desk chair over and joined them.

\"Shoot,\" I said, to Catherine.

Gregor\'s hands flew out in front of him. \"Catherine wants to---\"

Catherine threw her hand up like an old-fashioned cop making a stop sign
gesture. \"Give me a moment. Will you? You are so impatient.\"

He glared at her then looked across at me, hoping I\'d intervene. I
didn\'t know what was going on, so I made that shoulder shrugging
gesture that says, *I\'m on your side, but give her a moment, will you*.
He tightened his mouth and returned that raised-eyebrow gesture that
says, *Okay, you\'re the boss, but you\'re not going to like this.* Then
he folded his arms, leaned back in his chair and let Catherine speak.

Or at least, that\'s how I interpreted things. Maybe he\'d just had a
bad kebab the night before.

Catherine squirmed in her chair. \"Mark and I want to launch FPP with
basic web app functionality. Okay?\"

I shook my head emphatically. \"No way. Noooo way. We cannot risk
undoing all the good work we\'ve just done getting FPP on track.\"

She said, \"Hear me out, okay? We only need a small web app for our
December 1st release. Just enough so we can honestly add to our
marketing copy that we have one. We don\'t need the full web app we
descoped back in August. Customers can log in, check their balances and
transactions---those basic sorts of things. We can add more features
between December and April, if we need to. Okay?\"

I said, \"Not really.\"

I looked at Gregor and raised my eyebrows in that way that says *I see
what you mean* ...

She leaned forward and spoke in a hushed voice. \"Don\'t get angry with
me, okay? But I spoke to Ron and he said it would be easier than we
think.\"

What\'s the first thing you do when someone tells you not to get angry?
\"Catherine!\" I blurted. \"You went behind my back?\"

\"He said that adding simple web app functionality back on should be
relatively easy. He said a new team could work on it, mostly, without
interrupting the other FPP work by\"---she looked at her notes, then
made finger quotes---\"*by* *reusing the existing services and code.*
Whatever that means.\"

I nodded. Ron was right, technically speaking, but technically speaking
wasn\'t good enough. Technically speaking, I could pierce my nipples, if
I wanted to, but I didn\'t want to and so I wouldn\'t.

Gregor took his chance to speak. \"Yeah, but like I said, Catherine, no
matter what Ron says, it\'s still a decent sized project in its own
right, with a considerable amount of uncertainty. Projects like that
have habits of growing arms and legs.\"

She held up her hand again. \"I haven\'t finished yet.\"

I said, \"No. Catherine. I know how much you want this, but I have to
say no.\"

\"I was about to say---\"

\"No Catherine. I am sorry, but no. End of conversation.\"

Her nostrils flared. Her face tightened and her jaw jutted out and
quivered just a bit, as if she was deliberately forcing her mouth to
remain closed.

Moments passed.

Then she breathed out slowly and nodded.

\"Okay. I give up.\"

Gregor, happy he had won but looking to smooth things out, said in a
soft voice, \"You had to ask. You wouldn\'t be doing your job if you
didn\'t.\"

\"True.\" Catherine said, \"Well, in that case, there is one more
thing.\"

She flipped her laptop open and placed it on the table.

\"You recognize this?\"

It was Gregor\'s planning spreadsheet.

\"Of course.\"

Gregor nodded, but I could tell from his face that he had no idea what
Catherine was about to do. It was almost like she\'d set us up by asking
for something she knew she couldn\'t get, then asking for something
else, smaller, in our moment of weakness when we felt guilty for saying
no. I narrowed my eyes, watching her next move with suspicion.

She turned the laptop toward herself and away from us so that I
couldn\'t directly see the screen. She typed a bit, clicked a couple of
times, and then turned the screen back to face us both.

She\'d highlighted a row. It was a new row for a new feature named
Customer Level Income. It was at the top of the sheet, and had no
numbers in the Estimated Effort cell.

The name customer level income seemed familiar, but I couldn\'t place
it.

She said, \"What\'s stopping me from having this feature?\"

She\'d never asked to add something to the list before. The answer, I
suppose, depended on how much effort it would take and who we\'d need to
work on it. Adding a new feature to the top of the spreadsheet also
meant that other features would get pushed back and some of those
further down the priority list would miss the December launch.

I turned to Gregor.

His thick neck had turned crimson. \"Due respect and all, Catherine, but
we rejected that change request about seventeen times already.\"

Oh!

This wasn\'t a new feature; this was a change request. I\'d recognized
it because Gregor had rejected it in his management meeting, the one
where I\'d announced Phil\'s discovery about FPP and our War Room.

I leaned forward, suddenly very eager to see what happened next.

\"You did, indeed,\" she said, with false patience in her voice. \"But
last night, while thinking about work---sad, I know---I realized that I
no longer have to beg for change requests. Instead, I simply have to ask
you to ask your staff to estimate how long it will take, and then I
prioritize it against the other features we\'re delivering. So I\'d like
to know by lunchtime today, if you please, how much effort this will
take to ship and whether it puts our December date at risk. That\'s
all.\"

Her request sounded harmless, but I felt my jaw tighten. It felt like
she\'d played us, using our inverted pyramid approach as a weapon
against us. I stumbled around in my mind, looking for a reason to say
no. I couldn\'t find one.

I looked at Gregor, hoping he had some words of wisdom. He shrugged.

I scowled---a lot of good he was---and looked back to Catherine.

She summed up her argument. \"I am not requesting a change, Steve. I\'m
not even begging for a change. I am simply reprioritizing our list.\"

I said nothing as her words sunk in. She was right. This was not a
change request, this was a reprioritization.

I turned to Gregor. \"Can we absorb this and still deliver Catherine\'s
bare minimum?\"

\"We can absorb this, I guess, but not this *and* the web app.\"

Catherine sat forward in her chair. \"Your bottleneck improvements are
working and we\'re running at easily twice the speed we were a month
ago, right?\"

Gregor nodded and said, \"Probably more.\" But he didn\'t look happy.

\"So we\'ve got wiggle room. I know that when you add this feature I\'ll
lose some lower priority request from my must-have list. But I\'m
willing to make that trade.\"

I\'m quite sure I frowned a bit on the outside, but I also know for sure
that on the inside I was smiling. Catherine had just evaporated the
underproduction conflict I\'d discussed with Craig during the summer.

\"Okay. I can\'t see any logical reason why, Gregor, you can\'t get
Catherine the estimates she needs to decide whether this is viable or
not.\"

Gregor sucked in a sharp breath through what I guessed were clenched
teeth. \"Okay. I\'ll have a number for you by the close of business
tomorrow.\"

Catherine smiled sweetly, as if she\'d just won a small victory against
us.

Or maybe she was just happy, and I was interpreting her smile unfairly
because I felt like I\'d just given something away. Whatever it was, it
felt odd.

She said, \"Excellent! But look, I remember what your old estimate was
to make this change. Even if the new estimate is five times that, I
still want it. Pauline, my ex-friend, left before we came up with our
change request, so this will differentiate ours from Chaste\'s.\"

Gregor said, \"Okay. Unless you hear otherwise from me this afternoon,
consider it bumped it up to near the top of list number one.\"

Catherine stood and we shook hands. She smiled. \"Thank you. Thank you,
so much. This is awesome news.\"
