Chapter 27
==========

I took a moment or two to scan the restaurant. It was getting late in
the day, and a small line of evening shift workers stood in front of the
serving area. I knew they were evening shift staff because they wore
comfortable, casual clothing. For some reason I\'d never fathomed,
formal dress was only important if you worked daylight hours. Unless, of
course, you were a waitress, a bouncer or one of those old-fashioned
vampires.

I stuck my hand up, like a school boy. \"What next, chief?\"

Craig said, \"Well, we could spend a couple of hours debating whether
the lessons learned in a commercial kitchen can be applied to a software
environment---two very different situations, admittedly.\"

I nodded.

\"But we don\'t have time. We could go through my more formal process,
draw a bunch of clouds and then a few other diagrams.

I nodded again.

\"But we don\'t have time. So, since you\'re desperate, we will skip the
debates, skip the formal process, and instead figure out whether we can
apply the lessons from Cheryl\'s kitchen to your type of work. Okay?\"

\"Okay.\"

\"This process can take days, sometimes months. So we\'re going to speed
things up. I warn you: This might make your ears bleed.\"

I sat up straight in my chair. \"I\'m up for it. Where should we start?
With small batches?\"

He frowned, then shook his head. \"Before we talk about solutions we
need to agree whether, conceptually and practically, you suffer the same
problems.\"

I tilted my head forward, acknowledging his point, but thinking that
there was no point talking about a solution if we\'d already tried it
and it didn\'t live up to its promise.

I said, \"Before we do that, you should know that we already do an
enormous amount of in-process inspection.\" I wasn\'t sure if he\'d
remember the details of our earlier discussion.

\"You said.\" Then he went quiet. A minute passed, and then he smiled as
if pleased with himself. \"A question for you: From what Cheryl just
described, did in-process inspections and testing---what we call
building quality in---fully eliminate quality issues in her kitchen?\"

I shook my head. \"No. They improved the quality of their food further
when they switched to small batches. It stopped the food deteriorating
while it sat waiting to be consumed.\"

\"Good. You were paying attention,\" he said, \"Here\'s something that
Cheryl didn\'t mention earlier. When they started cooking in smaller
batches they started finding problems far sooner, when it was cheaper
and easier to fix them. It\'s the same in factories. If there\'s a
systemic problem in a manufacturing process that causes defects, then
they\'ll find it far sooner if they process batches of twenty widgets,
rather than two thousand. \"

I said, \"You keep talking about small batches, Craig.\"

"I know." He spoke firmly. \"But don\'t you start thinking too much
about them. Not yet.\"

\"Is that some reverse psychology trick intended to make me think about
them?\"

He smiled, and I thought he looked a little embarrassed. \"It is. It\'s
a frustrating feeling, isn\'t it?\"

\"Intensely.\"

He pointed at the FPP folder. \"Now, let\'s talk about forecasts.\"
