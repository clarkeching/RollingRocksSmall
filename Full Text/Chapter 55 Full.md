Chapter 55
==========

Monday, October 30th

A week later I went to meet Catherine for an \"urgent\" lunch in Lister
square, halfway between Wyx-Fin HQ and her new FPP call center on the
other side of the old town.

Lister Square sits smack in the middle of Watt\'s Bridge. The ornate,
stone council chambers, which look foreboding on a grey day and sparkle
on a sunny day, sit on one side of the square. A modern shopping mall
takes up another side and the city\'s ancient defensive walls guard
another. By royal decree back in the 1900s, the fourth side was left
completely clear in perpetuity, providing views out across the city\'s
lower wards and toward the sea.

Lister was an English surgeon who, while working up the road in Glasgow
in the 1860s, discovered he could save many of his patients\' lives by
washing their wounds and his surgical tools with a carbolic acid wash
prior to surgery. His practices spread across the world, saving many
lives, and he became famous. He had nothing to do with the mouthwash
Listerine, but it was named after him.

That seemed to be the way things were done back then. Lord Kelvin
developed the concept of absolute zero, in Scotland, and was
instrumental in rolling out the trans-Atlantic telegraph. He got a brand
of refrigerator named after him. Watt invented the steam engine in
Scotland, kicked off the modern world, and got his name plastered across
billions of light bulbs around the world. Mr. Steven J. Abernethy
invents a way to deliver an impossible project on time, and gets---what?
Plan B named after me? Plan Abernethy. Nice. Not.

I sat down on one of the benches in the middle of the square, near
another of Watt\'s Bridge\'s tourist attractions: Lister Fountain. I sat
facing the sun and the sea and just enjoyed the solitude. I was ready
for a little rest.

In the distance, a container ship sat on the horizon, waiting for a tug
to come and pull it into port. I yawned. Then, out of the corner of my
eye, I saw Catherine step out of the Marks and Spencer store and scan
the square. She carried a small Marks and Spencer plastic bag.

I stood and waved.

As soon as she\'d sat she pulled a large Caesar Salad roll from the
shopping bag and tore the plastic wrapper off. I noticed she had dark
rings under her eyes and her hair was tied back in an efficient, but
unflattering, ponytail. \"How was Madrid?\" she said, with a mouthful of
roll.

\"Barcelona. Though it could easily have been Madrid, or London, or New
York. Conference centers look pretty much the same no matter where you
are in the world. The lunches in Barcelona were particularly good.\"

\"Poor you, with your first world problems,\" she said
unsympathetically. \"If you don\'t enjoy the traveling, why do you keep
doing it?\"

I shrugged and changed the subject. \"How are you doing?\"

She swallowed and scowled. \"Steven, my get-up-and-go has not only got
up and gone, it\'s taken my will to live with it.\"

I deconstructed her sentence while I removed my own sandwich from its
bag.

\"You look tired,\" I said, pointing out the obvious.

\"No shit, Sherlock. While you\'ve been busy gallivanting around the
world telling everyone how great Wyxcomb is and having fancy lunches,
I\'ve been working my arse off.\" She sighed deeply. \"How\'s your
messaging system? Still stuck up shipment creek without a paddle?\"

I shrugged. \"The Australia team is packaging up their latest fix and
we\'ll have it tomorrow morning.\"

\"Odds of this fix working?\"

\"Honestly? It might work, it might not. But if it doesn\'t, then we\'ll
just start working on the new problem. And so on. This is how these
things work. It\'s just a matter of time.\" I didn\'t tell her about
Plan B yet.

She made an \"eek\" face. \"Mark spoke with Hal over the weekend.\"

\"Oh?\"

\"Hal wants us live, on December 1st, whether your software is ready to
launch or not. We will go live with a paper and spreadsheet solution, if
we have to, and key everything into the system when it\'s fixed. This,
Hal says, is an acceptable business risk, considering the tiny sales
volume.\"

I shook my head slowly, not liking it, but then I nodded.
\"Realistically, I don\'t think we\'ll need to do that. We still have a
month to go.\"

\"But you can\'t be sure.\"

I shook my head.

\"Okay. Now, I need your help.\" Her face darkened. \"I am drowning,
Steve. And, just so you know, it\'s your stupid fault.\"

I blinked. What now?

\"No one ever expected you to launch your software on time, Steve. And
if Mark and I had known you would pull off your little miracle then we
would have started our rollout work much sooner.\"

She stopped and looked at me, checking my reaction.

\"I understand that.\"

\"But now, you not only look quite the hero, but all that pressure you
were under---it hasn\'t gone. It\'s just slid down off your shoulders
and landed on mine.\"

She then listed off her problems on her fingers. \"One. We\'ve got our
internal launch event on the 17th. And, Mark being Mark, he insists on
putting on a big fancy show. An event is how he put it. He\'s invited
everyone of any importance---plus you, by the way. And he\'s written me
into the script. And you. You better dust off your best suit.\"

I raised my eyebrows wondering what part I\'d play in his little show.

\"Two. My team is mad busy creating the training material for our
branches and the call center and--- three---I\'m figuring out how to
roll the training out, once it\'s finished, to all thirty-six Scottish
branches during---I hope---the last two weeks of November, something
which, frankly, is---\" she checked I was keeping up, \"impossible.\"

\"Impossible?\"

She nodded. \"On top of all that--- four--- we\'ve got the ramp up of
the call center: the installation of the equipment, the recruitment, the
training, and so on and so on. And, of course, that task is bigger and
harder than we ever expected since I deprioritized a lot of automation
work so that you could deliver on time. And, while all this is going
on---five---I\'m still steering your team\'s development effort.\"

I said an ambiguous okay, unsure whether I was being blamed for this or
if she was just letting off steam.

\"Look,\" she said, clenching her hands, her roll forgotten for now.
\"Bottom line is, our ramp up and rollout is far from being a certainty.
Unless I do something drastic, it\'s very unlikely we\'ll be ready to go
live on December 1st.\"

\"You are kidding me?\"

\"Look at me. Do I look like I\'m kidding?\"

I looked at her and decided she most certainly did not.

\"Why didn\'t you say anything until now?\" She\'d had a month to figure
this out.

She looked down at her hands, then slowly up again. \"I\'ve been swamped
ramping up our ramp up and \... I never had time to sit down and figure
out if it were feasible.\"

I nodded sympathetically. I\'d been in that same place---too overwhelmed
to plan---just a few weeks ago.

Then Catherine smiled awkwardly, as if she were embarrassed. \"You know,
I feel awful saying this, but over the weekend, as the situation became
clearer, I almost found myself hoping your messaging system problem
doesn\'t get fixed, so you get blamed for us shipping late and not me.\"

I raised an eyebrow.

\"I said almost.\" She shrugged. \"I spent all Sunday with Mark, at his
estate. We have a plan, but we need your help.\"

\"Go ahead\"

\"We are in this together, you and me, right?\"

\"Of course,\" I said eyeing her suspiciously.

\"Good. There are two bits to my plan, and the first bit has a big
impact on your development team. I need more people working on the
rollout.\"

\"Let me guess. You want to borrow some of my FPP staff to help you with
your ramp-up?\" I smiled to show I wasn\'t entirely opposed to the idea.

She shook her head. \"No, actually, I don\'t. I need to move half of my
business analysts off your development work onto my rollout.\"

A chill crawled down my back. \"That\'s worse! My bottleneck will move.
Our developers and testers will become starved of work.\"

\"Maybe, maybe not. At the moment, most of the BAs aren\'t just doing BA
work. They spend over half their time helping with testing. I doubt your
bottleneck will move, but it might intensify. But, whatever. Honestly, I
don\'t care.\"

\"Don\'t care?\" I said. \"If you cut our bottleneck capacity the entire
team slows down.\"

\"The entire *development* team, but that\'s not our concern now.\" She
shrugged. \"I\'ve done some thinking and---you\'re not going to like
this---if we were desperate, we could go live with the GETS features we
already have under our belts.\"

The chill changed to heat and crept to my face. Hadn\'t we already
slashed the product back to its barest bones? \"How is that possible?\"
I stammered.

\"Last night, I took a red pen to our call center scripts and pared them
back enough that we could go live today with what we\'ve got. Don\'t get
me wrong. I don\'t want to go live today, but we could if we had to.\"

Unbelievable. Her bare minimum, her slam dunk scope, had shrunk yet
again. \"It would have been nice of you to let us know that earlier,\" I
said.

\"I didn\'t know earlier, and besides, I\'m still learning to work this
new way. I\'ve never had a genuine phase two before.\"

I studied her face and I realized that I was being hard on her. We were
all learning.

\"Fair enough,\" I said.

I closed my eyes a moment and cleared my head. \"Let me summarize. One,
Hal is willing to go live with a paper and spreadsheet solution if our
messaging system isn\'t live on December 1st. Two, you\'ve slashed your
slam dunk scope back even further. Three, you\'ll pull half your BAs
from the development work, and four, Gregor and Tim will figure out how
to adapt.\"

\"There\'s one more thing. It\'s a biggie for us, not so big for you.\"

That\'s what she thought.

It turned out to be enormous.
