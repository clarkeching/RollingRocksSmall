Chapter 25
==========

Cheryl\'s eyes narrowed when she saw me. \"You again?\"

I said, \"I\'m sorry how our last meeting ended.\"

She pursed her lips and studied my face. I guess she decided that I
meant what I said. \"You want to hear about our French Fry Revelation?\"

\"I do.\"

\"Follow me, then,\" she said, and led us through to her little office
where the three of us sat.

\"Last time, you heard how Craig forced us to eat our own dog food. That
led us to test our food and fix it, at first only after it was cooked.
But as we got better we learned to fix it before, during or after each
stage of the cooking process. Our products\' quality improved
enormously. That won us loads more customers. We made loads more money.
We saved our jobs. Remember?\"

I nodded. She was clearly proud of the achievement.

\"That was the first step,\" she continued. \"We call the next step our
*French Revelation*, which is short for French Fry Revelation. You\'d be
surprised how much you can learn from a few deep-fried potatoes.\" She
chuckled at her own joke. I chuckled too, politely. A lot was hinging on
this meeting.

\"Our revelation helped solve two problems. First, we cooked much of our
food long before we served it. So even though it tasted good fresh from
the kitchen, it didn\'t taste so good when it hit the customer\'s
plate.\" She stood up. \"Come with me.\"

She led us out of her office and through the kitchen\'s swinging double
doors down to the far end of the serving area. She pointed at the big
shiny things where the food was stored.

\"These are called bain-maries. They keep food warm after it\'s cooked
until it is served.\" She pointed at a large roast of beef sitting under
hot lamps. \"And those lamps, they keep the roasts warm.\"

I nodded my understanding.

\"Have you tasted two-hour-old cabbage?\"

I nodded. \"My Grandmother was an expert at one-hour-old cabbage.\"

\"It\'s not nice, is it? Now, Steve, we used to keep our food warm using
the bain-maries and heat lamps. Trouble is, if food sits too long it
transforms into ...\"

She looked at me, eyebrows furrowing, as she waited for me to finish her
sentence. I hesitated, then said, \"Dog food?\"

Smiling, she slapped me on the arm. \"You\'ve got a great memory,
Steve.\"

It hurt a little, but I was still pleased with her praise.

Then she shook her head, as if disappointed. \"Back then, we cooked our
food in big batches. A big pot of peas. A big pot of cabbage. A big pot
of carrots. They all went on at 10:30. Then, after they were cooked, we
moved the food to the serving area until folks came down for their
lunch. The food wasn\'t too bad if you ate at noon, but it was horrid at
2 p.m.\"

I glanced at Craig. He was listening with his head tilted to one side,
as if he were hearing her story for the first time.

Cheryl said, \"We used little catering tricks to prevent deterioration.
Like, did you know that by adding loads more oil to a big pot of curry
it will sit much longer on a low heat without burning?\"

\"No.\"

\"Well, you do now. Just remember that the next time you\'re tempted by
a cheap curry takeout.\"

I said I would. Then Cheryl asked me to sum up the problem she\'d just
described.

\"Your first problem was that your food deteriorated because you cooked
it too far in advance.\"

She nodded. \"Too far advance in big ...\"

I looked at Craig and smiled. \"In big batches. Not small batches, big
batches.\"

\"Our second problem was that on some days, especially rainy days, we
didn\'t produce enough food and the staff complained. But other days we
produced too much, and we chucked a lot of it.\" She turned to Craig.
\"Tell me again, what did you call that in industry?

Craig said, \"Producing stuff that doesn\'t sell is called
overproduction. Losing sales because you don\'t have what your customers
want to buy is called underproduction. Overproduction wastes a lot of
effort and money. Underproduction means you lose sales revenue. Both are
bad, but under-producing and losing sales is usually the worst of the
two.\"

\"On some days we\'d do both,\" Cheryl continued. \"We\'d cook up too
much soup but not enough lasagna. We guessed at the start of each week
how much to produce for the following week, and we almost always got it
wrong. You can understand that, right?\"

I nodded. How could you guess something like that?

\"Now, Steve, do you see the obvious solutions to these problems?\"
Cheryl asked.

I didn\'t. I\'d never worked in a kitchen or a restaurant. At college I
tutored high school kids; the money was better than waiting tables and
so were the hours, but it left fundamental gaps in my knowledge of how
to reengineer a staff cafeteria.

I shook my head. \"Honestly, I don\'t.\"

\"That\'s okay. Nor did we. But thankfully, that\'s when we had our
French Revelation.\" She led us back into the kitchen and over to the
deep fryers.
