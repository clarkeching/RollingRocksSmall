Chapter 5
=========

I dialed my other boss---my dotted-line boss---Norbert Billings, the
Wyxcomb Group CIO. Norbert was tall, blonde and Dutch, and he had worked
within the company ever since the company he had been working for was
acquired by Wyxcomb decades earlier. He answered after a couple of
rings, and I gave him a quick update on the FPP situation. He said he\'d
already heard the news. He offered no direction or advice, only a
request that I keep him up to date.

We talked for another fifteen minutes or so about the conference (he
congratulated me on my award) and other initiatives I was working on for
him---stuff that affected all software development activity across the
Wyxcomb Group and not just within Wyxcomb Financials, the subsidiary I
was working for.

Then Norbert blindsided me. \"Now, tell me, did you ever contact Craig
Lally?\"

Craig Lally worked somewhere upstairs in our TCQ team (our snappy
acronym for Total Customer Quality). Every Wyxcomb site had a TCQ team
that did training and consulting on whatever the Group\'s latest quality
initiatives were. Months earlier, Norbert had asked me and my
counterparts in the Group\'s other subsidiaries to meet with our local
TCQ team to explore how we could use *Best Practice Quality Practices*
within our development teams.

Norbert\'s gift, if you could call it that, was his ability to regularly
toss Idea Grenades over the wall. If we acted on every one of the
grenades, we\'d be so busy *improving* we\'d have no time left to do any
work. More to the point, I knew someone in Wyxcomb Health had contacted
this Craig Lally fellow, and they\'d ended up outsourcing their entire
development team. I did not want to be outsourced.

I\'d never met Craig and I wasn\'t in a rush to do so now.

I said, \"No. Not yet. We\'ve been particularly busy lately.\"

\"Funny, your colleagues in the other subsidiaries have been
particularly busy too. Did you, at least, read the report he wrote up
about his Wyx-Health work?\"

\"Ahhh, no, not fully, not yet.\" I could see it poking out from near
the bottom of a pile among the other clutter of my desk.

\"Craig strikes me as being a very thoughtful man \...\"

I said, \"I am sure he is \...\"

I heard him breathe out slowly. \"I want you to call him and I want you
to meet him. You work in the same building, for heaven\'s sakes. The
Health guys called him and they are based in another country. You know
Steve, even you might learn something.\"

Even me? Sometimes working for Norbert felt like being nibbled to death
by ducklings. A little nip here---*You don\'t ask for enough help*; a
little nip there---*Have you read this report*? None of the nips hurt
individually, but over time \...

\"Yeah. I know. You\'re right,\" I said out loud, trying to sound
suitably respectful while saying *nip, nip, nip* in my head. \"I\'ll
call him. But FPP\'s management meeting starts in a few minutes. I
really have to go.\"

\"Okay,\" he said. I thought I heard him sigh, and I felt bad.

We ended the call, agreeing that we\'d talk more the following week when
I was in Malmö. I glanced at the edge of Craig Lally\'s Wyx-Health
report and chose to ignore it, for now, at least. The last thing I
needed was a bunch of manufacturing guys who\'d lost their jobs because
their factories had been closed down trying to help me. I pushed my
chair back from my desk and headed out the door.

I had a very important meeting to gate-crash, a bunch of IT
professionals to fire up, and a metaphoric rug to pull out from under
them.
