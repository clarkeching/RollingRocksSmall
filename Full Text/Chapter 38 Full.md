Chapter 38
==========

Eleanor slammed her fist down on the table. \"Will you two deliver FPP
on December 1st? Yes or No?\"

It was just Gregor, Eleanor and me in the room.

Eleanor sat at the head of the table, ready to carve the two of us up.

I glanced at Gregor, half hoping he\'d answer and take the heat off me.
He looked down at his hands and said nothing, which was precisely what
he should have done.

I said, \"We might. We don\'t know yet.\"

\"What does that mean? Does it mean you have a plan which shows there\'s
a possibility you will deliver? Or does it mean you do not even have a
plan, so you really and truly are clueless? Which is it?\"

I let out a long breath. \"It\'s the second option. We don\'t have a
plan yet.\"

\"You\'re clueless?\"

I nodded, then hung my head.

\"Do you know how much is riding on this product?\"

Before I could answer, and probably make things worse, Gregor looked up
and said, \"We\'ve been very busy, Eleanor, getting the project back on
track.\"

\"I understand that, Gregor,\" she snapped. \"I\'ve just spent some
quality time with one of your teams, and it\'s clear you are
transforming your project. I am impressed, and under different ...
circumstances, I\'d be delighted.\"

I thought I noticed her chin quiver as she spoke.

I leaned forward and quietly asked, \"Circumstances?\"

She closed her eyes and rubbed them with the backs of her hands. A few
moments passed, then she spoke to me quietly and deliberately. \"Halifax
and I have made a very big promise to some very important people. We
cannot keep our promise unless real customers are buying FPP on December
1st.\"

I nodded but said nothing, hoping she would share more.

She looked at Gregor, then back at me and said, \"Was it not obvious
when Halifax declared that we would ship on December 1st and beat Chaste
to market that it was an act of desperation?\"

Her face had turned ashen. When Hal burned our boats, it was not just
bravado. He\'d made a big bet that we would deliver on time and he
would, therefore, keep his promise. Or else.

I looked at Gregor. \"We can have a plan together by ... Friday?\"

He nodded emphatically. \"Friday.\"

\"And will this plan tell me whether we can definitely launch by
December 1st or not?\"

Gregor and I both said, \"Yes.\"

\"I need it by Monday.\"

I glanced at Gregor. He nodded.

I said, \"Monday evening.\"

She nodded. \"Right. Now, let me be clear. If there\'s a plausible risk
we won\'t be live on December 1st, then I need to know. Do you
understand?\"

\"Yes.\"

Gregor looked directly at Eleanor, \"Can you tell us more about the
promise you have made?\"

\"I could, but I most certainly will not.\"

\"Can you tell us what the consequences are if we\'re not live on
December 1st?\"

Her mouth tightened. \"Jobs are at stake, and not just Hal\'s and
mine.\"

She stood and headed to the door, then turned back towards us. \"Just in
case it\'s not utterly clear, I will be delighted if you come back to me
on Monday with an honest and emphatic *yes*, but I will be enormously
unhappy and vindictive if you tell me *yes* and then we run late. Do you
both understand that?\"

We both nodded like two schoolboys relieved they\'d not been expelled.
\"Yes.\"

She stepped out of the meeting room and gently closed the door behind
her.

As soon as the door was shut, Gregor pushed himself back in his chair.
\"There goes our weekends.\"

\"Sorry about that.\"

He shrugged. \"It\'s part of the job. I wasn\'t doing much, anyway.\"

I said, \"I\'m booked to take my kids to Euro Disney this weekend. It
was meant to be a surprise.\"

\"That\'s a pity.\" He frowned, then offered a half-hearted smile.
\"Though, I guess, it\'s lucky your kids don\'t know what they\'re
missing out on.\"

\"What makes you think it was luck?\" I said, grimacing. \"I stopped
making promises to my kids a long time ago. It wasn\'t fair.\"

We spent the next quarter of an hour figuring out how to produce our
plan. To be fair, it was something we would have started shortly,
whether we\'d talked to Eleanor or not. Gregor already had the bare
minimum list of test scenarios that had to pass before we could go live,
as well as estimates for how long it would take to execute them. We
didn\'t know how many defects we would find or how long it would take to
fix and then retest them, but we could estimate those. Given those
inputs, we knew we could come up with best, most likely, and worst case
delivery dates.

Gregor said, \"You know, Steve, if we come back with a maybe, and I
think we will, then Eleanor\'s going to be very unhappy.\"

\"I got that impression.\"

\"But there is another option open to us. A get-out-of-jail free option.
Except it\'s not free, of course, nothing is.\"

\"Is there?\"

\"We could easily slip back to plan A---lower our quality standards and
stop producing GETS software. Then we\'ll hit our date, no problem. We
can fix the problems after we go live. Hardly anyone will buy the
product until April, anyway.\"

I shook my head. I really did not want to do that. But, as a last
resort ...
