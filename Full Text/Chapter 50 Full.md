Chapter 50
==========

Monday, October 16th

I worked with Gregor and the rest of his team for the remainder of that
week, and then felt so good about things I took the kids (and my laptop
and a backlog of ebooks) to the Canary Islands for a couple of weeks\'
sunshine. I asked Mom to come along, but she gracefully declined. She
didn\'t say it, but sometimes she needed a break, too.

While I was away I read *The Goal* and re-read *Made to Stick*. I
started contemplating how I might rollout some of the lessons we\'d
learned from FPP to new projects.

When I returned to work the following Monday, just over ten weeks had
passed since Phil discovered Chaste\'s plan, eight weeks since we had
inverted FPP, and three weeks since we\'d discovered we would---unless
something disastrous happened---make our December 1st date.

During those three weeks, Mark and Catherine decided to only sell FPP to
existing Wyxcomb customers, which cut our pre-December development
effort considerably, and to rollout FPP only to our Scottish Branches
before December 1st. We would then rollout to the rest of the country in
the new year, which created a little extra work for our development team
but gave Catherine\'s team time to set up her call centers and implement
training in the branch in a careful and controlled manner. That said,
she was up against the wall and was now the project\'s critical path.
She and her team had a hectic six weeks ahead of them. And after we
launched, their workload would be higher than originally expected
because she was going live with more manual tasks than planned.

Our initial bottleneck improvement tweaks were bedding in nicely and our
newly named flowmasters had created their own simple three-list systems
on whiteboards, one per team, which made each team\'s work visible and
easier to coordinate. Phil commented that it was the first visible
change to our workplace in years, and although they could have used
spreadsheets, I loved how, on Monday morning, I got a sense of how
things were going just by walking around the office.

So things were going well, which made me happy.

Later that evening, though, I got a nasty surprise in the form of a
sensible question. A strangely technical email query from Eleanor.

**Steve-**

**How on FPP do you really know that your software really is GETS,
considering you haven\'t shipped anything yet?**

**Curious.**

**Perhaps Ron can help?**

**E**

Ten seconds later I was on my way to Ron McKnight\'s office.

As much as it pained me, I needed help from the old man.
