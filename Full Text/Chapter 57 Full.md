Chapter 57
==========

Friday, November 17th

Two weeks later, on Friday the 17th of November, we launched FPP
internally, in the basement auditorium of Watt\'s Bridge HQ. Eleanor and
I sat in the back row.

\-\--

We started with darkness.

And silence.

Then the boom of one hundred Irish tap shoes thundered out over the
auditorium\'s sound system.

Tikatakaitikataktic. Tikatakaitikataktic. Tikatakaitikataktic,

It was from Riverdance. I learned that during rehearsals.

Tikatakaitikataktic, tikatakaitikataktic, tikatakaitikataktic,
tikatakaitikataktic, tikatakaitikataktic, tikatakaitikataktic,
tikatakaitikataktic, tikatakaitikataktic, tikatakaitikataktic,
tikatakaitikataktic.

Then silence again.

Then light.

Just one light.

From the back row of the auditorium, I watched the spotlight pierce the
darkness and highlight Mark Richmond, Wyx-Fin\'s chief marketing officer
and showman, standing at the front of the stage. He wore a top hat and
tails and gripped a megaphone in his hands, holding it out in front of
him like James Bond with a pistol.

He leaned into the megaphone. \"Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to
you---Future Perfect.\"

Mark dropped the hand holding the megaphone to his side, then twisted
his body to his right and pointed his other hand toward the projection
screen. From the distance, I could just make out the faint outline of
the screen as it reflected light from the spotlight.

The spotlight switched off and the screen filled with a colorful
photograph of a large family gathering. Gentle music played in the
background. The photo suddenly burst into life to reveal an eightieth
birthday party. An old man sat in an old wooden chair, his whole
family---his wife, children, grandchildren, maybe even a
great-grandchild---singing \"Happy Birthday.\" His wife held his hand
and the man looked very happy.

The camera zoomed in on the elderly couple\'s faces, the singing faded
away, and suddenly their faces lost fifteen years. The camera zoomed out
to reveal a retirement party with the same wife and kids, though younger
and with fewer grandchildren and no great-grandchildren. The camera
zoomed again and the process repeated three more times, with the couple
losing a decade or so each time until we saw the same couple, now in
their thirties, with an infant child bouncing on the mother\'s lap. They
beamed with obvious joy at a very pretty Wyx-Fin saleswoman.

The wife, who held the Wyx-Fin application form clearly in view, turned
to her husband and said, \"We\'re in safe hands, darling.\" The picture
froze and morphed into a photograph. A deep and reassuring male voice
ended the segment: \"Wyxcomb Financials' Future Perfect, for your
perfect future.\"

Cheesy? Oh yes. But they worked. The Wyx-Fin family series of adverts
had been at the center of Wyx-Fin\'s advertising strategy for the last
half dozen years because, as cheesy as they were, they pulled customers
into our retail branches and made us buckets of money.

The spotlight came on and highlighted Mark once again, the megaphone
gone now. Theatrically, he rolled up his sleeves, and like a magician
proving he had nothing to hide, he held out his fists and slowly opened
them palms-up, proving to any cynics in the audience that they were
indeed empty. Then he sprang into the air and seemingly snatched the
application form straight out of the photograph on the screen. He landed
and smiled broadly, waving a real application form at the audience.

Like I said, cheesy.

The overhead lights came on. Mark stepped down off the stage and walked
to the front row until he stood in front of Catherine. He bowed to her,
then handed her the application form. She accepted it gracefully, with a
small nod.

The audience erupted in applause.

All except for Hal.

I watched him intently from my vantage point in the back row. He knew
what was about to happen, but he\'d been clear in rehearsals that he
didn\'t approve of theatrics. As soon as the applause died down, he
stuck his hand up as if he were a schoolboy seeking permission to ask a
question. This wasn\'t part of our script.

Mark, though momentarily thrown, kept smiling. \"Hal?\"

\"Smoke and mirrors?\" spat Hal. \"Is that all you\'ve got? Smoke and
mirrors?\"

Mark\'s a pro, though, and he didn\'t lose his cool.

\"No sir,\" he said, with what I knew to be mock respect. Then he turned
to the audience, his smile looking a bit forced now. \"Enough with the
sizzle. Let\'s talk about the steak.\"

Mark quickly bought everyone up to speed about FPP\'s history and future
and then handed the microphone over to Catherine, who quickly described
FPP\'s back office setup. She clicked on her laptop and its screen
appeared on the overhead screen, showing the FPP software we\'d spent so
many months building.

She held the application form Mark had given her for everyone to see,
then opened it and gasped in feigned surprise. \"Is there a Mr. Steven
J. Abernethy in the room?\"

\"Up here,\" I said, waving. The audience spun toward me then back to
Catherine.

Catherine laid the application form on the table in front of her and
quickly keyed my details into the software, explaining some of the
special features of the software as she went. The audience let out a
quiet murmur of appreciation when she demonstrated the customer level
income feature, explaining how Chaste\'s product definitely did *not*
have this feature.

She finished keying the application, clicked the submit button and asked
me to join her. As I made my way toward her, she opened up the laptop\'s
browser and navigated to FPP\'s custom login page.

She handed me a large hat with the words \"S. Abernethy, Customer\" on
it, and I put it on. I typed my user ID and password, quickly clicked
through the few options that were available to me and stepped back from
the PC. There wasn\'t an awful lot to see, really, but the point was
that there was *something* to see, and all of our colleagues were seeing
that something.

\"Thank you, Steven,\" Catherine said, dismissing me, and I slipped back
to my seat.

Catherine looked down at the screen and chuckled. \"Typical IT guy. You
forgot to log out, Steve.\"

The audience laughed and Catherine logged me out.

That wasn\'t rehearsed. I was more nervous than I had realized.

She looked out toward the audience and asked, \"Are there any
questions?\"

There was silence, as always, so Mark jumped in with the first question.
\"I have a question for you, Catherine.\"

But Hal interrupted. \"Hang on, Mark. I\'ve got a question, for your
customer Abernethy at the back of the room.\"

My heart jumped into my throat.

\"I think everyone here would like you to confirm, Steve, that there
will be no technical hitches when we go live on December 1st?\"

I was surprised at the contempt in Hal\'s voice, especially since he
knew the answer. I was even more surprised when sixty-plus very
important heads spun to face me, many of them frowning---recalling messy
launches from the past, no doubt.

Mark, Catherine, and I had practiced the answer to this question, but
the question wasn\'t supposed to come from Hal. It was supposed to come
from Mark. Hal had forced us to jump ahead a page or so in our script.

I nodded thoughtfully. This was our moment. Time to unveil our first
gift-wrapped pig.

I choked. My heart was still in my mouth, and it seemed to be blocking
my tongue.

Catherine jumped in to save me, \"Let me answer that, Halifax,\" she
said, and the heads spun back to the front of the room to face her.

\"Mr. Steve Abernethy is in fact our seventeenth live customer.
*Live*.\" She waited a moment to let that sink in. \"After seeking the
appropriate independent advice last week, Steve filled out the FPP
application form while in our Watt\'s Bridge High Street branch, and
I\'ve just keyed his real, live application into our real, live
system.\"

\[The messaging system fix had come through the previous week, and we\'d
been running FPP live in production since then.\]

Catherine paused. \"What you\'ve seen was not a demonstration. It was
very, very real.\"

The heads turned back slowly to face me. It was obvious, judging by
their expressions, most still didn\'t understand.

My heart had crept back down in its proper place, and I spoke loudly.
\"I make my first payment---of real money---on the 21st of November.\"

Still nothing.

Mark stood up, lifted his megaphone, and shouted, \"FPP is alive and
kicking two weeks ahead of schedule!\"

It took about five seconds for his words to sink in, and then the room
let out a collective gasp of approval and started clapping.

Eleanor, our ninth customer, jabbed me with her elbow. I turned to her,
and she mouthed the word *nice* to me.

I whispered back to her, \"I think so.\"

\"And ...\" Mark said, giving the audience time to turn back to him, \"a
selection of our other Scottish branches will start selling Future
Perfect in early January, three months ahead of our original schedule.\"

An appreciative murmur rose across the auditorium.

Marked continued, \"Once those branches are bedded in, we will rollout
to our other branches. Our major U.K. branches will be selling FPP by
the new financial year.\"

Mark took a step back and stretched his body to full height.

\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" he cheered, raising his hands as he did so.
\"FPP is live!\"
