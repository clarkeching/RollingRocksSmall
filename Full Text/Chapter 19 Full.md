Chapter 19
==========

Wednesday, August 16th

Life rolled along fine for the next week or so, until precisely 2:22
p.m. the following Wednesday when the shit hit the fan.

I should have worn goggles to work that day.

I was in our weekly project status meeting with two exchange staff who
were nearing the end of a six-month stint in Watt\'s Bridge and would
soon be returning to their home office in Madrid. We were just about to
wrap up when someone rapped on my office door.

I opened it. It was Eleanor.

\"Where the hell is your staff? How the hell will FPP come in on time if
no one is working on it?\"

\"Pardon?\"

She looked past me, noticed I had company and then forced on a clearly
false smile and politely asked them to leave. I invited her in as they
slipped away.

She closed the door. \"I just walked past your FPP team space, and apart
from a few contractors, the place is deserted.\"

I said the staff was probably in meetings, that I would check it out and
that I really didn\'t appreciate her interfering. I was sure, I said,
that if I happened to be standing outside her office and glanced in, it
would be empty. That didn\'t mean she wasn\'t working, it just meant she
wasn\'t there.

\"One of your contractors snitched. The permanent staff is all on an
extended lunch break in a pub. You have a mutiny on your hands.\"

\"I doubt that.\"

\"Listen to me,\" she said sharply. \"Hal is making an announcement this
afternoon. It is embargoed until the press release and I can\'t tell you
what it is now, but you should watch your email. It affects you and your
team.\"

I nodded.

\"You\'re not going to like it.\"

I snorted. \"So, he\'s not resigning then?\"

Her mouth opened just a bit, and she forced it shut. \"Hal and I are on
the next flight to Sweden and I wouldn\'t have come down here except
that I have a message for you from Hal. It\'s not for anyone else\'s
ears.\"

I waited.

\"Launch FPP on time. Or find a new job.\"

Bam! I flinched. Boom! It felt like she\'d just slammed me across the
face with a coal shovel.

She opened my door and stomped out, then slammed the door hard enough to
rattle the glass wall.

I winced. Everyone in the office must have heard it.

I sat down and cupped my face in my hands. I waited until I heard the
elevator door *ding*, then made my way to the FPP work area. I walked
straight-backed, and even though I made no eye contact, I felt the eyes
of all my other staff following me as I crossed the building. When I got
to the FPP area, I discovered Eleanor was right. The lights were on but
none of the permanent FPP staff were home.

No, that\'s a bad way of putting it. For all I knew, they *were* at
home.

I tracked them down by picking on the closest contractor and asking her
where everyone had gone. Her reluctance to snitch soon faded when I
reminded her I signed off on her agencies\' invoices and approved their
contract renewals. She suggested I look in a popular lunchtime pub not
far from the office.

Eleanor was right. It seemed that Gregor---or more precisely, Gregor and
I---had mutiny on our hands.
