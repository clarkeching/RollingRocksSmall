Chapter 60
==========

I closed my eyes and let my head fall back. If my eyes had been open, I
would have been staring at the ceiling.

They weren\'t telling me everything. We were, of course, in the middle
of a negotiation. They were selling me on staying by emphasizing the
pros and downplaying the cons of staying, while emphasizing the cons and
downplaying the pros of leaving. If Norbert were there, he\'d do exactly
the same, but from his perspective, to suit his agenda.

And then I did something I\'d never done before.

Silently, I squeezed my right hand. On the one hand, I could take the
new job.

I wriggled my right shoulder. What would I gain from taking the new job?
An awesome and influential job.

I squeezed my left hand. On the other hand, I could stay.

I wriggled my left shoulder. If I stayed, then I\'d possibly help save
my friends\' jobs. And for nine months I\'d avoid an increased travel
workload and get to spend more time with my family, which was good for
them and for me.

I tipped my head slightly. The overarching need was my and my family\'s
happiness.

I blinked my eyes open and searched for a moment for inspiration amongst
the ceiling. I found none, so I closed my eyes again and summarized the
conflict. I was torn between my own personal ambitions and the happiness
of my friends and family.

This choice wasn\'t just about me.

Phil\'s advice to me long ago, that if you\'re jet lagged you might as
well be eating bacon, did nothing for my mom or my kids, who bore the
brunt of my travel.

I was sick of the travel. Bacon can\'t solve every problem.

Or can it?

Pigs don\'t just make good bacon, they also make good gifts---if you
have a nice ribbon and know how to wrap it.

I opened my eyes. The new job\'s pig was clearly the increased travel.
But what was the value of being \"important\" if my family suffered?

I smiled. I had the pig, and in that instant I figured out what the
ribbon was. Now all I had to do was the wrapping.

I said, \"We\'re only talking about nine months? And we\'re negotiating
right now, correct?\"

Hal and Eleanor both agreed. Eleanor was smiling hopefully, and Hal was
doing his best to look neutral.

\"Good.\" I pulled out my mobile and dialed Norbert\'s number, then
switched it to speaker mode and rested it on the bench top.

\"Hello, Steve. How did your launch go?\"

\"Great. We need to talk.\"
