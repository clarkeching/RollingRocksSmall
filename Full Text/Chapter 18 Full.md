Chapter 18
==========

We walked back to the coffee area without speaking. I picked up my
folder of requirements from the table. I didn\'t sit.

I said, \"I\'m sorry Craig. I know you know your stuff, but I don\'t
have time for this now.\"

\"I understand your reluctance but you should know this: Given what
I\'ve heard about how you work, I know I can help you.\"

I was dubious. \"Really? You can help me deliver FPP on Hal\'s arbitrary
date without sacrificing too much quality?\"

\"No, but I can help you figure out how to prevent the next FPP debacle.
I\'m sure of it.\"

I took in a deep breath and looked him directly in the eyes. I knew he
was serious. But with FPP, which was the only thing I really cared about
right then, he was too late. I think we both knew that.

\"I do not need your help, Craig.\"

He flinched, and for a moment I regretted my words.

\"Look. You just can\'t compare a kitchen with a software development
organization. We are just too different.\"

Craig\'s face lit up. \"Tell me more about that.\"

I shook my head. \"I don\'t have time.\"

\"Two minutes is all it will take. Tell me why they\'re different.\"

\"Okay. But If I tell you, will you tell Norbert we played together
nicely?\"

His smile faltered. \"If that\'s what matters to you, yes.\"

Good. I had what I wanted.

I said, \"I don\'t think you, with your manufacturing background, can
possibly appreciate the scale of what we do. Our software is enormously
more complex and complicated than any physical product manufactured
anywhere in the world.\"

He pulled a face, clearly unconvinced.

\"How many components do you think a large airliner has?\" I said,
though I had no idea what the answer was.

He shrugged, \"A few million, I guess.\"

\"And how many customers does it carry at one time?\"

\"A few hundred.\"

\"My team upstairs looks after forty-seven million lines of code. And
that\'s only what we\'ve written ourselves over the decades; if you
included the off-the-shelf components we use, that number would be five,
ten times bigger. Maybe more. The software we build manages millions of
transactions worth many millions each week, for over six million
customers.

\"Print out an aircraft\'s schematic designs then weigh them. I\'ll do
the same with my code base. I think we both know which would be
heavier.\"

"You\'re right, but I don\'t think you can compare the two like that."

"And I don\'t think you should compare my software development project
with a kitchen."

He nodded, then said, "We seem to be arguing."

"We do."

"Let\'s find something we can agree on, then." He pointed towards the
cafeteria\'s kitchen. \"Those guys cook their food using a very
different workflow than the people who created the recipes in the first
place. Do you agree?\"

"Of course. Developing a new recipe would be iterative and would require
a lot of trial and error. Cooking a recipe should be foolproof." Then,
recalling the conversation we had just had, I added, "Or, at least,
foolproof subject to the quality of the ingredients and sensible
processes."

"So which of the two processes---developing the recipe or cooking it---
does your software development process resemble most?"

That was easy. "The development process, of course. We are called
software *development*, after all. We develop the recipes---the
algorithms, the step-by-step instructions---which our computers execute,
or if you like, cook."

"Interesting." He tilted his head to one side and smiled. \"To me,
speaking as an outsider, your industry\'s core problem seems to be that
you build software based on a model that is applicable to manufacturing,
or cooking, but you don\'t do manufacturing. You do development. We
should discuss that.\"

He gestured towards the seat, inviting me to sit.

I kept my face neutral. I saw what he was doing. He was trying to create
a gap in my head which I could only fill if I stayed and talked. But I
was too wily to fall for that old trick. Instead, I leaned forward and
we shook. "Another time, maybe."

"Maybe. Maybe not." He shrugged again then smiled, as if to show he held
no grudge. \"I\'ll email Norbert and let him know we had a useful
conversation, but that we\'re not taking it any further.\"

He stood, and I watched him walk over to Cheryl who was talking with
some of her staff by the cash registers.
