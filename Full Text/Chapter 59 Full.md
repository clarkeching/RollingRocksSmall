Chapter 59
==========

Eleanor pulled out her mobile, glanced at the screen and said, \"Halifax
will join us shortly.\" She then promptly ignored me and used the spare
time to process her emails.

I looked at my watch. I had promised to call Norbert the moment we
finished. Did I have time to make the call? He said it wouldn\'t take
long, but I decided to wait until Eleanor, Hal and I had caught up.

Mark had laid out celebration drinks and snacks in the cafeteria next
door. Later that evening, the entire FPP project team---the folk who had
actually done the work---were heading to the Watt\'s Bridge Castle
conference center for a celebration dinner, and then, for the young and
young at heart, a disco.

Once the room had emptied, Hal hopped out of his front row seat and
marched up the central aisle steps towards Eleanor and me. He swung
himself into the seat beside me. For a man his age he was surprisingly
agile.

We shook hands. \"That went far better than I expected,\" he said.

\"Gee, thanks.\"

He lowered his voice. \"Norbert is telling everyone in Group you\'re a
superhero and inverting is your secret weapon. I\'ve asked my mother to
knit you a Christmas jumper with a great big red I on the front.\"

I smiled politely. He had a caustic way of saying thank you. \"And you,
Hal? What do you think?\"

His eyes narrowed. \"You got lucky. Lucky to be managing the wrong
project at the right time. Lucky to be working for two tough bosses. One
who forced you into an impossible situation and one who forced you to
talk to that Lally fellow who then helped you dig yourself out of that
situation.\"

I blanched.

\"You asked.\" He shrugged. \"To be fair, you did perform well under
pressure.\"

That was when the tennis match started. Eleanor and Hal were the
players, one sitting either side of me, and I was the ball spinning
backwards and forwards, left then right, as they talked.

Eleanor served first. \"Actually, Steven,\"---she gave me time to
turn---\"that is Hal\'s way of saying thank you. We both agree you did a
splendid job. And ...\" she said, leaning forward and glaring at Hal,
\"Hal and I have a favor to ask of you.\"

Hal said, \"I have some new information for you, then you have a choice
to make.\"

I turned to face Hal. \"Choice?\"

He surveyed the room, checking no one could overhear our conversation.
\"You can\'t repeat what I\'m about to tell you. Understand?\"

I nodded.

\"Let\'s start with what you already know. One, we made a huge bet when
we invested in Future Perfect. Two, it is supposed to resuscitate
Wyx-Fin. Three, it might still do that, though we can\'t know how well
it will sell until the new financial year.

\"Now, here\'s what you do not know: When Group agreed to this bet, they
made it clear that if the new Future Perfect product is not a
significant commercial success, then we will get sold to the highest
bidder.\"

\"I see.\" Although I wasn\'t privy to the details, I wasn\'t surprised.

\"So, when Chaste came along they blew our business case out of the
water. My bosses, figuring their bet was bust, wanted to put Wyx-Fin up
on the chopping block. I persuaded them to make another, smaller, but
equally important bet.\"

I said, \"You bet we could deliver the FPP project impossibly early.\"

He nodded.

I smiled, though I was worried about where the conversation was heading.
\"That bet, at least, seems to have paid off.\"

He did not return my smile. \"Correct. We are not currently on the
auction block. But, to be clear, the bigger bet has not yet paid off. If
Future Perfect does not sell exceptionally well between April and August
next year, then Wyx-Fin still gets sold. You understand?\'

I sucked in a sharp breath and held it as I absorbed this new
information.

If Wyx-Fin was sold, it would probably be to a competitor. They\'d pay
more than a non-competitor because they could eliminate a lot of
duplicated infrastructure and staff costs. I\'d be out of a job almost
immediately, and over time so would be most of my staff. Hal and Eleanor
would leave the company with a cloud of failure sitting over them.

That wasn\'t good for us as individuals, but it made business sense. The
Group purchased subsidiaries like ours as investments. If they could
make more money selling us and investing the money elsewhere than they
could by keeping us and reaping the ongoing profits, then that\'s what
they had to do.

Then I recalled my Kelvin\'s Peak phone conversation with Eleanor, when
I had told her FPP would ship by December 1st. I turned to face her.
\"But what about the four million pounds extra profit you forecast
Future Perfect will bring in?\"

She said, \"The extra cash is nice, but it\'s a one off, an unexpected
bonus. Without it we\'d have been sold by now, but in order to truly
prevent the sale, Future Perfect must be a significant commercial
success. That four million pounds we talked about was based on a very
pessimistic forecast. Future perfect needs to sell much better than
that.\"

\"And that\'s why we are talking now,\" Hal said. \"Our business case
assumed a much bigger product with many, many more features than you
were able to deliver. Plus, of course, we have an aggressive and popular
competitor. We expect sales to be much lower than we hoped.

\"Worse, if Future Perfect actually does sell well, our administration
costs will be much higher than expected. The web app was supposed to
allow our customers to do much of their own administration work, to
self-serve, but your web app is tiny. That means Catherine\'s call
center and back office will need to be much bigger to cope with the
extra administration. On top of that, you descoped most of our back
office automation, so their work will be very costly and time consuming.
Our future is far from perfect, Steve.\"

Eleanor said, \"But, as grim as that sounds, Future Perfect is live and
the FPP team is working to fill the gaps in the product. Thankfully,
your defect rate is extremely low, so they will spend their time making
genuine improvements rather than fixing bugs. So there are some
positives.\"

I said, \"Nine months is a surprisingly long time.\"

"Exactly. Less than four months have passed since we stumbled upon
Chaste\'s plan. Your new way of working is new to us; we don\'t know how
to work this way yet, but we are looking forward to finding out. Who
knows what miracles you and your team can pull off between now and
August ...\"

She left her question hanging there, as if I was supposed to answer it.
So I did. \"Especially, if we change our goals from delivering FPP by a
fixed date to making Future Perfect financially successful.\"

Hal cleared his throat. \"Which brings us to your choice.\"

\"My choice?\"

He nodded towards Eleanor. \"You tell him. Technically he works for you,
not me.\"

She sighed. \"You see, Steven, now that FPP is now live, Norbert wants
you, come January, to work full-time for him in a new job, helping
others across the group invert their projects. Initially you\'ll be
rescuing the most important in-flight projects, and then later figuring
out how to invert new projects from the start. It will require more
travel, but you seem to like that.\"

My mouth fell open. Apart from the travel, that sounded like the job of
my dreams. She\'d just described a very high-profile role, which not
only would have visibility across the group, but also the potential to
have a real and positive impact. It wasn\'t the job I\'d been aspiring
to all these years---it was better than that. Where was the choice in
that?

\"We\'d prefer you stay,\" Eleanor said, and her serious tone made me
wary.

\"Well, I can see that ..."

Eleanor said, \"HR informs me that I cannot force you to stay, but
Norbert won\'t force you to take the job either, since you have a young
family. The transfer is not mandatory.\"

That was when Hal started his sales job. \"You shouldn\'t think of
staying as just helping Future Perfect.\" He shook his head. \"Think of
it as possibly preventing the sale of the company, and more importantly,
saving your staff and your friends\' jobs. We are the only major
employer of computer people in Watt\'s Bridge.

\"And, also, it\'s not really a choice. We\'d just like you to delay
accepting that new job until August next year. You\'ll have a better
story to tell by then, anyway. Hopefully.\" He shrugged, as if he
didn\'t care, though he clearly did. \"The choice is yours.\"

Eleanor rested her hand on top of mine. \"We need your decision by
Wednesday. It\'ll be difficult to find a replacement at this time of
year.\"

She and Halifax both stood to leave.

\"Wait,\" I said.

They both stopped and looked at me, expectantly. And so they should
have. I held all of the cards, and clearly, they needed me more than I
needed them.

I said, \"Sit.\"

They sat.
