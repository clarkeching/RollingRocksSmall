Chapter 23
==========

Craig answered, then paused as if I\'d taken him by surprise. \"I
didn\'t expect to hear from you again.\"

He sounded more distracted than surprised.

I apologized for how our breakfast meeting had ended, then asked him if
he could please spare me thirty minutes to help me out with FPP.

\"Thirty minutes? I don\'t have thirty minutes to spare.\"

\"Fifteen minutes, then? It shouldn\'t take more than that.\"

\"I\'m afraid I am very busy just now.\"

I steeled my jaw. \"I\'m desperate. I swear I wouldn\'t ask otherwise.\"

Another pause. \"Yes, okay. I\'ll give you ten minutes, but no more.\"

I thanked him. I had no intention of just sticking to my ten minutes.
\"We\'re experiencing a few little problems.\"

\"Little problems? You said you are desperate.\"

\"No, desperate is accurate.\"

I spent the first eight of my ten minutes explaining why I was so
desperate, glossing over the details of the mutiny.

He summed up matter-of-factly. \"So, your concern is this: Hal Gibbet, a
man not known for taking prisoners, expects you to deliver FPP by
December 1st, but you don\'t know how long it will take to build the
remaining features, then test and rework them; therefore you don\'t know
if you can keep your promise. Is that it?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"The cloud we drew. Has anything changed?\"

\"It\'s the same cloud, just much worse. The date\'s shrunk and the only
way we can possibly deliver on time---and that is very unlikely---is to
cut more features and risk a shoddier, riskier product.\"

\"That\'s good.\"

\"Good? How?\"

\"Let\'s use that pressure to advantage. A noose around one\'s neck,
they say, is very good at focusing one\'s thoughts.\" He laughed when he
said it.

I didn\'t laugh. It was *my* neck he was talking about. At least,
that\'s what I thought.

I told him my ten minutes was up.

\"Your crisis has come at a very inconvenient time for me. But give me a
few moments, okay?\"

I heard his muffled voice as he carried on a conversation in the
background. He was back a couple of minutes later.

\"I need to make a phone call. I\'ll call you back.\"

I hung up, and three minutes later my phone rang.

\"I\'ve just spoken with Norbert. I\'ve cleared my diary for the
afternoon. I\'ll meet you downstairs, in the cafeteria, in twenty
minutes. Bring your FPP folder with you.\"
