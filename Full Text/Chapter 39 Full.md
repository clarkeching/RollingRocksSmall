Chapter 39
==========

Sunday, September 24th

\"You look like a bag of bums, Steven.\"

It was 4:52 p.m., Sunday. I was standing in our little kitchen with Mom.
I\'d spent all weekend working with Gregor, and I was exhausted and sick
of him and his spreadsheets. And now, apparently, I didn\'t look my
best.

\"Thanks, Mom,\" I said. \"We have ten weeks to go. We\'re already
one-third of the way through our recovery, but we\'ve only delivered
one-sixth of our minimum set of features. We have sped up, but even so
we cannot make December 1st.\"

\"But you\'ve put so much work into this project.\"

\"Yeah.\" It was kind of her to say, but it didn\'t help.

I watched as she put the kids\' dinner, little smiley face pizzas, onto
a baking tray. The girls would have helped prepare them earlier. She
slid them in the oven, then we went through to the lounge and sat.

One of our cats---the girls named him Purronimo, but we just called him
Mo---came in and meowed for attention. I crouched down and rubbed him on
the back of the neck.

\"If we get incredibly lucky, we\'ll deliver a bare bones system in late
November. More likely, we\'ll deliver sometime in February or March. If
things go badly ... well ...\"

\"How often do you get incredibly lucky, Steve?\"

\"Never. We know we\'ll speed up, but we\'d have to run at least twice
as fast as we\'ve assumed to have a reasonable chance of hitting
December 1st.\"

She said, \"Oh dear.\" I went to the oven and checked the pizzas through
the glass window. The cheese hadn\'t quite started bubbling yet, but
they looked good. How come the girls were allowed pizza for their dinner
and I wasn\'t?

\"They need a couple more minutes.\"

\"I know,\" Mom said. \"Now tell me. What did Craig say about all
this?\"

I looked down and mumbled, \"I haven\'t spoken to him.\"

\"Speak up, Steven. It sounded like you said you hadn\'t spoken to
him.\"

I looked up at her. \"He\'s traveling. I haven\'t spoken to him.\"

\"He\'s got a phone, hasn\'t he?\"

I shrugged teenager-like, using just one shoulder, and grunted,
\"S\'pose.\"

\"Steven,\" she said disapprovingly. She went to the door and called the
children.

Much later, my darling mother would describe this as the moment when the
impossible happened: A man stopped, admitted he was lost and asked for
directions for the second time in the same calendar year. I called
Craig.

My call went straight to voice mail. I listened to his message but hung
up before the beep.

I shouted so Mom could hear me, \"Voicemail. He\'s in Latvia.\" Oh well,
at least I tried.

\"So email him.\"

\"Okay. Later.\"

She came to the door. \"Do it now. And since you\'ve been such a good
boy, you can have some of the kids\' pizza.\"

I made a sulky face and pulled out my phone. I tapped out a quick email
summarizing my situation and asking Craig for his advice.

The kids came in, and we sat around the table and talked while we ate.
School was good. TV was better. Boys were smelly. Alison thought pink
was the best color in the world; Ashley, being older and wiser, thought
it was babyish. Those sorts of things. Important things.

Then we played a game called \"Jump on Dad,\" which involved me lying
down on their trampoline, pretending to be asleep, and them jumping on
me with a *splat*. If they jumped hard enough then they woke me up and I
had to chase them, kiss them, and tickle them until I got so tired I
fell asleep again. After ten minutes of that I took them upstairs and
gave them a bath.

When I finally made it back downstairs Mom said she\'d heard my phone
beep.

Craig had emailed me.

**Where is FPP\'s bottleneck?**

I read his response out loud.

Mom asked, \"Where is it?\"

\"I don\'t know.\"

\"Then email him back and tell him you don\'t know.\"

I did as I was told.

He responded ten minutes later.

**Look, so far you\'ve turned your software development teams into a
factory---a test-scenario processing factory. You need to figure out
where your bottleneck is because it determines how fast your factory
runs.**

**I want you to read *The Goal* and follow its instructions. You\'ll
find a copy in my office. Cheryl may still have a copy too.**

**I\'m off scuba diving very early tomorrow morning and then I\'m out of
email/phone range for the following three days, canyoning. I don\'t know
what canyoning is, but I had to sign a half dozen waiver forms because
of my age. Wish me luck!**

A moment later, another email beeped for attention.

**Ask Cheryl to show you her bottleneck.**

I read the emails to Mom, and then downloaded the ebook version of *The
Goal* to my tablet. Two minutes later, I sat on my office couch reading
it. It was a full-length novel, not a text book, so I couldn\'t just
flip to the index and look up \"bottleneck.\" I hunkered down.

Forty minutes later, Mom called me to my dinner. I wolfed it down, then
when I revealed I was only on page thirty-two, mom said she\'d do the
clean-up---just this once!---provided I bought the audiobook version and
listened to it on double-speed.

I did as I was told. And soon I was sound asleep on my couch with the
book playing away in the background.

I woke just after 1:30 a.m. I was still on the couch but someone---a
burglar perhaps? Maybe my Mom?---had removed my glasses, unplugged my
earphones and placed a blanket over me. I dragged myself upstairs to bed
and set my alarm for extra early.
