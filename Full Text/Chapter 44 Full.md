Chapter 44
==========

I settled on tea, figuring I\'d already had too much coffee. I drank it
in the darkest corner of the staff cafeteria, carefully avoiding eye
contact, just wanting quiet time either to think or to not think, I
wasn\'t sure which. After half an hour of thinking and not thinking, I
headed back to my office. I was still a good ten feet away when I heard
Gregor exclaim, \"Are you nuts?\"

My door was closed.

I gingerly tapped on it, then nudged it open. \"Who\'s nuts?\"

No one answered, so I ventured in. Gregor was leaning against the wall,
his neck red. Catherine sat with her laptop open in front of her,
looking defiant.

\"Gregor thinks I am crazy.\" She shrugged. \"But, if he were to hear me
out, he would discover that I am freakily sane.\"

Gregor let out a long breath through pursed lips.

She pointed at her laptop screen. \"Do you want to see why?\"

I pulled my desk chair over to the table and sat down.

\"Gregor filtered my copy of your spreadsheet to highlight work with the
highest test effort.\"

I frowned. \"You wanted to see what features use most of our bottleneck
resource?\"

\"I want to slash any test-heavy scope, if I can, and save us that
testing effort.\"

Now I knew why Gregor was angry. \"How can you possibly do that when
you\'ve already cut the scope to its barest bones?\"

\"Things change.\" She shrugged. \"I can\'t speed your team up, but
maybe I can shorten our journey.\"

Gregor grunted. \"True, but you\'re going too far.\" Maybe I didn\'t
understand why he was angry after all.

She ignored him and pointed at the screen. \"These are all of the test
scenarios needed for the Search screen. It\'s a busy screen, with many
combinations, and it requires a lot of testing. I\'m comfortable going
live with just a subset and then adding others later, if we need them,
after December. Understand?\"

\"Ah ha.\"

She said, \"Initially, I figured we only needed surname, date of birth,
account number, and post code for launch, but then I got brutally honest
with myself and decided I only need one search field. That\'s when
Gregor went nuts.\"

\"Just one field?\" I glanced at Gregor, who raised his eyebrows.
\"Which field?\"

Catherine folded her arms. \"Surname.\"

\"You\'re nuts!\"

I heard Gregor mumble, \"That\'s what I said.\"

\"I\'m not. I\'m talking about what we need for when we go live. Let me
ask you, Steve, realistically, how many people are going to buy our
product in December and January and February?\"

I said, \"A few thousand?\"

\"Let\'s say we strike gold and it\'s five thousand. Every customer
knows their own surname, and worst case we might have a few dozen Smiths
and Jones and McDonalds. My staff can search by surname then scroll and
scan, as need be.\"

I said, \"Okay...\"

\"Then, in January, I\'ll ask my staff what fields they desperately need
next and I\'ll ask you to add them.\"

Gregor now looked as if he wished he\'d let Catherine explain her
rationale before reacting. He mumbled, \"It doesn\'t sound so bad when
you put it that way.\"

I nodded. \"We\'ll add them in phase two and you can get them in, say,
March.\" I mulled on that a moment. In my head I still had it that
December through March we\'d be nursing FPP into life, like we usually
did. But if we could both run faster and shorten the journey while still
building GETS software, then that wasn\'t the case anymore.

Catherine said, \"After we\'ve launched, we\'ll ask which gaps most need
plugging. We\'ll plug them, and keep doing that until we run out of
budget.\" She turned to me. \"That\'s how it will work, right?\"

I said, \"Yeah, of course,\" though truthfully I\'d not thought that far
ahead. \"We\'ll use phase two to enhance the product and to fix any
urgent defects.\"

\"Good. In that case, Gregor, can you defer these search scenarios?\"

Gregor updated the spreadsheet and ran a macro that recalculated the
plan. Our earliest possible date had shimmied back almost a week.

\"We hit pay dirt, boys,\" Catherine said. \"Shall I keep digging?\"
