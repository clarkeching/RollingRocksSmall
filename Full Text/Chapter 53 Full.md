Chapter 53
==========

Later that evening, after I\'d put the kids to bed and feeling in a
positive frame of mind, I returned to the office. Ron had been helping
our operations guys prepare to move FPP into our live environment, and a
plan had been slowly forming in the back of my mind ever since
Catherine\'s visit earlier in the day. I needed to run it past him.

I poked my head around his office door and knocked.

\"Any news on our go live?\" I asked.

\"Nothing exciting.\"

\"Good.\" I stepped into his office. \"Can you, maybe, help me with a
problem, then?\"

\"Of course.\"

\"Catherine called by my office today. She had two change requests. I
approved one of them. I wanted to talk about the other one.\"

He seemed to redden a bit, embarrassed perhaps that Catherine had spoken
to him behind my back.

He said, \"The FPP web app?\"

I nodded. \"You told her that it would be easier than most people think
to build an FPP web app.\"

\"I wasn\'t meaning to step on anyone\'s---\"

I put my hand up. \"I\'ve thought about it, and it\'s a good idea.\"

\"Oh?\"

\"It\'s not like this is the first website we\'ve ever built, so can use
existing architecture, infrastructure and processes. Plus, we\'d call on
FPP\'s existing services, and unless we find problems with those
services, there should be little need to modify FPP\'s code. So, yes, I
agree it is relatively easy to do.\"

\"Okay.\" He still looked suspicious. \"So why do you need my help?\"

\"I want one of your teams to build it. Incrementally. Using your
three-list system.\"

\"Incrementally?\"

I nodded.

He picked up a pen and started tapping it on his desk. \"Which team?\"

\"Well, it would have to be a team with experienced web developers,
right?\"

\"Of course. And they\'re all plenty busy.\"

\"So I\'d have to find a team that could cancel their existing work
easily.\"

\"Easily? Good luck with that.\"

\"I could rely on luck, Ron. Or, I could find a bunch of projects whose
sponsor really, really, really wants FPP to succeed. Do you know where I
might find someone like that?\"

His face lit up and he pushed back in his chair. \"Oh, that\'s clever!
Mark cancels some of his own, less important, web projects and then
moves the people working on them onto FPP. FPP gets a web app. FPP is
more appealing and it sells better. Mark looks good. We look good.
Good.\"

He paused and looked at me as if seeing me for the first time. \"They\'d
need help from an FPP analyst, since my guys have no FPP business
knowledge.\"

\"Yes. I was thinking of Krzysztof.\"

Ron thought a moment. \"Yes, I like him.\"

I said, \"And we\'d need a list \#1. I could do with your help putting
that together.\"

His face opened up into a broad smile. \"You want to take a stab at that
now?\"

It took just over twenty minutes to list and prioritize all the things
we thought the new FPP website could do. Ron typed them into a
spreadsheet he named FPP Web List \#1. Some features---Login, Register
and Forgot-Password---came mostly for free because we used our existing
infrastructure, but our new team would have to build other features that
were specific to FPP. Some features were mandatory, some were vital,
some were nice to have. List \#1 was like one of those huge, multi-page
menus you get in some Chinese restaurants. Our next job was to pick just
a few dishes from the entire menu, move them to the top of the list, and
then place our first order---what Ron called Drop \#1.

Another twenty minutes later we had a draft plan for Drop \#1. We
figured it would take between three and five weeks from when we started
construct until Drop \#1 was technically GETS. Drop \#1 was like the
foundation and ground floor of a tall building. We\'d do a lot of work,
but since most of it was hidden, we\'d have little to show for it: a
dashboard with nothing on it apart from the customer\'s name and account
number and a balance. We\'d build it so it was technically GETS, but
Catherine would have to decide whether it was commercially GETS before
we considered going live with it.

We then sketched out how we might add slices of functionality on top of
Drop \#1 until we had four months\' worth of work ahead of us. We were
kicking the tires, trying to determine if we could launch FPP in
December with a bare bones website that we could then grow, slice by
slice, by April. We figured we could, even if we got unlucky. These
subsequent drops of features were like adding more floors to our
imaginary high-rise, and since they would be built on a solid
foundation, we\'d make much faster progress than with the first drop.

Just before 10 p.m. I called Mark and suggested that if we cancelled
three of his marketing projects, we could build him a bare bones FPP
website---one that was good enough to claim truthfully that FPP had a
web app, but would then grow as need be over time.

He asked me if I was serious. When I said I was, he offered to name one
of his illegitimate children after me, an offer I declined politely. I
called Catherine and she asked me if I\'d been drinking. It wasn\'t
until Ron took my phone and told her it was true that she believed me.

When Ron had finished his conversation and hung up the phone, I stuck my
hand out toward him. He looked at it hanging there, considered it a
moment, then reached across and we shook.

As soon as that awkward moment had passed he said, \"Do you know what
you\'ve just done here?\"

I wasn\'t sure what he meant, so I gave him a few obvious answers to
choose from.

\"We\'ve just figured out how to build a web app?\"

\"Yes, but I\'m thinking of something far grander, far more significant
than that. We build web apps all the time.\"

\"We\'ve just delighted Mark and Catherine.\"

He shook his head.

\"We just made the company more money?\"

He shook his head then gave me a hint. \"You\'ve inverted something from
scratch.\"

\"Oh.\" I blinked, then repeated his words. \"We\'ve just inverted our
first project, from scratch.\"

He smiled and started tidying some papers on his desk. After a minute he
said, \"That wasn\'t what I was thinking of. You inverted something far
more important than a little web project.\"

I frowned, but nothing came to me. I looked up again and said, \"Hint?\"

He shook his head.

What had we done? We\'d created a brand new, very important project, but
that wasn\'t it. And in order to do that we\'d postponed a few
considerably less important projects.

That was it.

\"We just inverted our projects list?\"

He nodded.

We had three lists of projects: those not yet started, those in
progress, and those we\'d finished. Mark and I had just moved one
project from Project List \#1 to Project List \#2, and moved three
projects from List \#2 back to List \#1.

I said, \"I never thought of it that way.\"

Ron smiled, and I realized for the first time after years of working
with him that hidden under his gruff exterior was a genius. His way of
working looked simple, but it was simple by design. That wasn\'t easy.

I said again, \"We\'ve just inverted our projects list.\"

He nodded. \"Not entirely, but you\'ve made a start.\"
