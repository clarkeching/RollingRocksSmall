Chapter 28
==========

\"Forecasts?\"

\"Does your FPP project have a forecasting problem, like Cheryl\'s team
did?\"

I closed my eyes again and tried to imagine Cheryl\'s problem, to make
it more concrete in my mind. If they forecast at the start of the week
that they\'d sell two hundred servings of lasagna but only sold
one-fifty, then they wasted fifty servings. If they sold all two
hundred, but there was demand for two-fifty, then the next fifty
customers missed out, resulting in lost sales. FPP had that same
problem, but on a much larger scale.

\"Mark and Hal kicked off FPP based on forecasts of how well it will
sell when it hits the marketplace. They did market research, surveys,
studied goat entrails and tea leaves and consulted an oracle, and in the
end came up with a range of sales figures. They estimated their running
costs and decided FPP was a good commercial bet, and they\'ve been
crossing their fingers ever since.\"

Craig said, \"So they still have a big Market Risk.\"

I nodded. \"They don\'t know how well it will sell. And if FPP sells
less than their forecasts, we\'re in big trouble.\"

\"And they don\'t know when it will start selling either, do they?\"

\"No. *How well* FPP sells is not my problem, thankfully, because I
can\'t affect that. But as you know, *when* it starts selling has become
my problem.\"

\"Tell me, do FPP\'s features match your future potential customers\'
needs?\"

\"I hope so, but like I said, that\'s beyond my control.\" I shrugged.
\"We spent a big chunk of time at the start of FPP working with
Catherine\'s team, nailing down their requirements.\"

I picked up the requirements folder, turned to the last page and held it
open in front of Craig so he could see my signature and Mark Richmond\'s
signature, both of which had been captured as digital images, at the
bottom of the page.

Craig nodded. \"Your requirements document acts like a contract then?\"
He glanced at the bottom of the page. \"A three hundred and twelve-page
contract between you and your customers?\"

I folded my arms. \"Essentially.\"

He took the folder from me, weighed it in his hands, then flipped
through the pages before handing it back to me. \"Is this the original
requirements document or the current requirements document?\"

\"The original. We descoped many of the original requirements. Our
analysts use a spreadsheet now.\"

He pushed himself back in his chair and stretched his neck and
shoulders. \"These things you call *requirements*---I don\'t think that
word means what you think it means.\"

I said nothing.

\"If they were genuinely required\"---he made little quote marks with
his fingers---\"then that implies they were mandatory. And if they were
mandatory, then how could your customers descope them? How could they
possibly be required one minute, then not required the next? They sound
more like requests or guesses---as in \"we think we\'d like
this\"---rather than mandatory requirements.\"

Craig jabbed at the folder with his forefinger. \"Here\'s how I see it,
Steve. When your team wrote this document, it was in fact a forecast,
nothing more than a prediction or an educated guess.\"

I shook my head. \"We put a lot of effort into getting that right.\"

\"But it wasn\'t right, was it?\" he said. \"How many times have you
descoped requirements?\"

\"Twice.\"

\"And the requirements that remain, do you think your customers would
change them if they could?\"

I nodded and thought back to the long list of change requests Gregor was
working through before I told the team about Chaste\'s skullduggery.
\"Yes.\"

He lifted the folder and handed it to me. \"Can you show me where, in
this requirements document, is the requirement to ship on December
1st?\"

I shook my head. \"Come on, that\'s not fair. That\'s a different type
of requirement.\"

\"Fair enough.\" He nodded. \"This document was your and your
customer\'s forecast of what FPP could deliver, and it turned out to be
incorrect. Forecasts sometimes do that.\"

My face felt hot---from embarrassment or anger, I wasn\'t sure. As much
as my instincts were to fight him, he was making sense. Maybe he had a
point. I exhaled, then banged my fist in the palm of my hand. \"You
could look at it that way ... you could say we guessed incorrectly and
you\'d be right \... but that\'s not our fault.\" I didn\'t like how
awkward and defensive I sounded.

I deepened my voice. \"We *had* to descope. Our customers needed us to.
We couldn\'t deliver the product within commercially acceptable
timelines otherwise. Look, you know this. I explained it to you
earlier.\" I shook my head. \"You cannot blame us for that.\"

His face fell away, as if I\'d disappointed him. \"Blame? I\'m not
blaming you. Things changed; you adapted. That\'s good. My question is,
why did you build stuff that you then had to descope?\"

My voice wanted to rise into a defensive whine again, but I fought it.
\"We had to descope because we screwed up our estimates and the project
took far longer than we expected. If we had gotten the dates right, we
would have cut the scope far earlier, before we\'d built any of it.\"

\"So, your end-date was a forecast too?\"

\"An estimate.\"

\"Same thing.\"

I shook my head vigorously. \"You\'re playing word games with me!\"

\"It\'s annoying isn\'t it? But the words you use are wrong, and because
they\'re wrong they give the wrong impression and cause the wrong
behaviors. Forecasts, by definition, will sometimes be right and will
sometimes be wrong; otherwise we\'d call them facts. Do you understand
that?\"

\"Perhaps,\" I agreed reluctantly.

\"Here\'s the lesson: You can blame yourselves when your forecasted
requirements are wrong, or you can change the way you work so it matters
less. I live in Scotland where it rains a lot. So, in April when the
weather is particularly variable, even if the weather forecast says
sunny, I still carry an umbrella.\"

\"How do I do that? How can we build software if we can\'t define it
clearly and unambiguously up front?\"

He shook his head. \"That\'s for you to figure out.\"

I slumped back in my chair, closed my eyes and thought about how
Cheryl\'s team wasted a lot of food and disappointed a lot of customers
by cooking to a forecast. They\'d fixed that by making an initial
short-range forecast, then cooking in small batches and changing what
they cooked based on actual demand.

The French Fry Revelation.

Small batches.

I opened my eyes and looked at the requirements folder. I recalled a
saying by some advertising guy who said he knew that half of his
advertising budget was a waste of money, but he just didn\'t know
*which* half. How could we possibly know, at the start of a project,
which half of my requirements---or forecasts, or requests, or
whatever---were less important and could be sacrificed later on, if we
had to descope? Our customers only ever figured that out when things got
tight and when IT resource was scarce. If only they could---and
would---do that at the start.

I leaned forward in my chair. \"You really aren\'t going to tell me the
answer, are you?\"

\"I didn\'t tell Cheryl and she figured it out. And many very clever
people have learned from her story since then. I\'m sure you will figure
it out too.\"

He reached across the coffee table and patted the requirements document.
\"This document is just over three hundred pages long, Steve. How thick
would it be if your analysts rewrote it so that it matched the
spreadsheet they\'re currently using to track your requirements?\"

I shrugged, feeling momentarily defeated. \"Maybe eighty pages, maybe a
hundred.\"

His jaw dropped. \"I had no idea.\"

\"Few do.\"

\"So you\'ll deliver one third of the original requirements? Wow.\"

\"Yep,\" I said. Then I smiled and added. \"But it is the most important
third.\"

\"Explain.\"
