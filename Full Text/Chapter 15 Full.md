Chapter 15
==========

And then something strange happened.

Feeling rather pleased, I picked up the pad and read the cloud back to
myself again. Then I read it again, and then again---and then again.
Each reading it became more familiar. And the more familiar it became,
the less exciting it seemed. In less than two minutes, my diagram
transformed from something fresh and enlightening into something
familiar and old. I realized that I\'d known it all along, and I found
myself annoyed that I\'d just spent precious time drawing a picture of
something I already knew.

I glanced at my watch, but it was too soon to leave without appearing
disrespectful to Craig---and to Norbert.

I pointed at the paper. \"Isn\'t all this obvious?\"

\"Is it? Good. That probably means it\'s correct.\"

I frowned at his answer.

He leaned forward. \"It\'s a specific example of a very common conflict,
Steve.\"

\"What do you mean?\"

\"Do you think you\'re the first project, or business, or even industry
to think you can go faster by sacrificing quality?\"

I shrugged. \"Probably not.\"

\"For some reason, most people view them as alternatives; you either get
quality or speed, not both. But if I were to sum up the entire quality
movement in a short sentence, it is this: Quality, done right, increases
speed and productivity.\"

I smiled. \"That\'s your thing---quality---so you would say that.\"

He didn\'t smile back. \"Quality is just one of my three main things:
Quality, Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints.\"

He leaned back in his chair. I waited for him to draw me a picture of a
three-legged stool or a pyramid, but he didn\'t. He just sat back and
smiled.

The ball was in my court. \"Do you really think I can solve this problem
with FPP?\"

He shifted, just a little, in his seat. \"I don\'t, actually. I suspect
the die is cast for FPP---you\'ve been working on it for many months
now, after all. All you can do is wait and see what numbers come up.
What we *can* do with FPP is use it to prevent the next FPP.\"

I looked down at the pad then back up to him again. I was dubious, but
at least he hadn\'t tried to outsource my team.

I said, \"What\'s next?\"

\"I want to show you a living example of how Lean and Quality Thinking
dramatically improved the lives of hundreds of people in this building.
I suspect you have the same problems, and maybe you can use the same
principles---though not the same practices---to evaporate your cloud.\"

I frowned and said, \"Why not just skip to the last page and tell me who
did the murder?\"

\"You won\'t believe me if I tell you. You\'d just argue with me. You
need to hear the story, and then figure out which bits apply to you.
Trust me, Steve. This is how I work.\"

\"Okay,\" I said tentatively. \"Tell me then, which business is your
showcase?\"

\"Before I tell you, you must promise to spend at least the next hour
with me.\"

\"Promise? I\'m not five years old, you know.\"

He raised his eyebrows but remained silent.

\"Okay.\" I threw my hands in the air to make light of my exasperation.
\"I promise.\"

\"You\'re sitting in it.\"

I looked around. \"The cafeteria?\"

He smiled and shrugged the world\'s tiniest shrug.

\"You\'re serious?\"

He nodded the world\'s smallest nod.

I considered refusing, but I decided to give him ten minutes. Then, if
it wasn\'t working out, I\'d break my promise and walk away. Norbert
would understand. Some promises aren\'t worth keeping.

Craig stood and started walking towards the cafeteria\'s serving area. I
rushed to catch up with him. I noticed that he walked with a limp.

He spoke quietly as I fell in place beside him. \"I joined the TCQ team
three years ago, after Group offshored my factory to Indonesia. It was
that or early retirement. My wife threatened to leave me for a younger
man if I took early retirement, so here I am.

\"My new TCQ colleagues worried that my manufacturing skills would not
be very useful in offices and call centers, so they started me out on
something safe---a test, I suppose---helping facilities outsource the
running of this cafeteria.\"

He slowed and turned to catch my eye. \"And guess what?\"

\"What?\"

\"My manufacturing skills *were* helpful, and they\'ve been helpful in
every assignment since. And guess what else.\"

\"What?\"

He didn\'t answer right away, and we continued ahead to the service
area, where he stopped me with a light hand on my shoulder. \"In the end
we didn\'t outsource anyone.\"

He gestured for me to step through the gap between the salad bar and the
cash registers, moving from the public part of the cafeteria into the
working part. I felt like I was trespassing, but I did as I was told.
