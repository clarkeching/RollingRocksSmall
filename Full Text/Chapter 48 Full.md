Chapter 48
==========

\"Eleanor Scharlau speaking. How may I help you?\"

\"It\'s Steve. I have some good news for you, Eleanor.\"

\"I heard. From Mark. And I have some questions for you.\"

So much for the \"well dones\" and \"thank yous.\" And so much for
Catherine\'s vow of silence.

\"Okay.\"

\"I need to calibrate your confidence level. Answer honestly. Will you
take a one hundred pound bet against me that you will go live on
December 1st and Mark will get everything you\'ve promised?\"

Strange question, but I answered without thinking. \"Of course.\"

One hundred pounds was a nice dinner for two. Not that I had anyone to
eat it with.

\"One thousand pounds?\"

I paused before answering. That was a reasonable amount of money, a very
nice new television. \"Of course.\"

\"Ten thousand pounds?\"

I bit down on my lip. Serious money. If Fran were still alive, she would
get very grumpy if ten grand suddenly disappeared from our check
account. That was enough to buy a small but zippy new car.

\"Is this for real? Or are you asking me hypothetically?\"

\"Answer the bloody question.\"

\"I\'d take that bet, and before you ask,\" ---I felt myself getting
annoyed---\"I would happily bet one million pounds, but only
hypothetically. I\'d feel awkward taking your money.\"

\"That\'s what I wanted to hear. Good work.\" Then a pause. \"Honestly,
Steven? I didn\'t think you had it in you.\"

\"Gee thanks, Eleanor.\"

\"Tell me the details.\"

So I did. I talked. She listened.

I was still talking ten minutes later when Eleanor cut in---it was the
first time she had said anything besides the occasional *um-hum* and *I
see*. \"Hold the line please, Steven.\"

Abruptly, I found myself listening to Wyx-Fin\'s hold music.

Three minutes later I was still on hold, so I muted my mobile phone, put
it on speaker and rested it on the rock beside me.

I checked that the phone was definitely on mute, then said out loud,
\"Steve, you are awesome.\" Just because I was alone and I could. I
figured I\'d earned that pleasure.

I took a few nibbles from my baguette as I waited.

I heard a man shouting behind me. I turned and saw a black Labrador
bounding towards me, chasing a tennis ball. Behind him, an elderly
gentleman carrying the dog\'s lead hobbled towards us. The dog raced
past me, caught the ball mid-bounce and turned and raced back towards
the man. They played tug of war with the ball for a few moments before
the man pulled the ball away and tossed it in the opposite direction.
The dog took off after the ball with the old man following along behind,
barely able to keep up.

As I waited, I thought about how our news changed things. A few hours
earlier, FPP was a failing project, and I was failing with it. But now
FPP was succeeding and I was looking---and feeling---somewhat heroic.
Heroic and exhausted. I needed a holiday. I owed my kids a holiday. We
all needed a rest.

Finally the music stopped and Eleanor came back on the line.

\"Steven. Hal and Mark are here. I\'m putting you on speaker.\"

I quickly picked up the phone and switched off mute and the speaker.
\"Hal, Mark.\"

\"Abernethy,\" said Hal, gruffly.

\"Steve,\" said Mark.

Hal said, \"Is it true what Mark and Eleanor tell me? We will ship on
December 1st?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"Do you have any doubts at all? Think carefully before you answer.\"

\"None.\"

\"Okay. Tell me this then. In return for this certainty, are you
delivering me a half-arsed product?\"

\"Mark and Catherine should judge that, not me.\"

\"They tell me FPP is considerably smaller than intended, but in some
ways better, simpler. Makes me suspicious. Sounds like they\'re blowing
smoke up my kilt. I want to know two things. Is it worthy of the great
Wyx-Fin brand and will customers buy it. Mark tells me the answers are
yes and yes. But he would, wouldn\'t he? What do *you* think,
Abernethy?\"

I didn\'t imagine he valued my opinion, but I answered directly
nonetheless. \"I\'d buy the product. And I\'d recommend my friends buy
it too.\"

He said nothing for a moment. \"Then, in that case, so will I.\" His
voice got quieter, as if he had turned away from the speaker phone.
\"There you go Mark. I\'ve just made your first two sales for you.\"

I heard Mark say thanks, though I don\'t think he meant it.

Just before the hold music came on again, I heard Hal say faintly,
\"Maybe there is hope \...\"

A few minutes later Eleanor took me off hold. \"We\'re alone again.\"

\"Hal seems happy.\"

\"Shush now, though. Give me a minute to think.\"
