Chapter 33
==========

Do you know any ex-smokers who only found the impetus to give up smoking
after surviving their first heart attack?

I know two.

FPP was in a state of emergency---my equivalent of a heart attack
survivor---and I had to make the most of that.

I dialed Catherine\'s number, but it went to voice mail after the tenth
ring. I had just turned to walk back towards the kitchen when my own
phone rang.

Without looking at the screen to see who was calling, I pushed the green
button and put the phone to my ear. \"Catherine. Could you have told us
what FPP\'s minimum viable solution was---the bare bones solution from
the War Room---way back at the start of the project?

She didn\'t even pause for breath or tell me off for calling her after
hours. \"Of course.\"

\"Can you roll forward to December, after FPP is live? Can you tell me
what we should be working on next?\"

\"Sure, my team has put together a spreadsheet of all our potential
post-implementation work.\" She quickly rattled off the top half dozen
features that came to mind. \"I\'ve a copy of the spreadsheet on my
laptop. If you give me a minute I can tell you exactly what they are.\"

\"Sure.\"

\"But first, is FPP doomed? Vrinda said you\'re working on a plan, but
she didn\'t sound confident.\"

\"I am working on a plan.\" When I heard my own voice I was surprised at
just how confident I sounded. \"Now, can you get me that list of
features?\"

While I waited, I walked across to my office at the other side of the
house. I fired up my laptop, connected to the Wyx services and opened up
the same spreadsheet. My laptop got there about twenty seconds sooner
than Catherine\'s. I used the time to scan through the list of features.
I wasn\'t really interested in what they were, but I needed to hear why
Catherine had chosen those features and why she ordered them as she did.

A few moments later she started talking through the features, starting
with those we hoped to tackle in December.

When she\'d finished, I said \"Could you have given me that list back
when FPP was first kicked off?\"

She took a moment. \"Maybe. The essence of the list would have been
similar, but the details would have been fuzzier because we hadn\'t
worked them out yet.\"

\"You\'ve learned a lot about the product since we started, then?\"

\"Of course.\"

I thanked her again, then asked if she could spare me a few more
minutes.

\"What else would I, a good-looking single woman in the prime of my
life, be doing in the evening? Having a social life?\"

I ignored her sarcastic comment, and instead asked her to describe her
rationale when ranking FPP\'s features in the War Room.

I scrolled to the top of the spreadsheet and listened as she worked her
way from the top-most feature down, explaining as she went why each
feature was more important than the one below it.

As Catherine talked, I recalled how I explained complicated slideshows
by revealing concepts bit by bit, building the idea up over time and
taking care not to overwhelm my audience with too much info. Then I
thought of how Ron\'s support and maintenance team built up our product
in the same way: They started with an existing system and then added to
it bit by bit, one change request at a time.

And then another piece of my puzzle revealed itself. How was Ron
McKnight able to reschedule his CORETRAN work to suit FPP\'s new release
date so easily?

That was easy: Ron was flexible because he kept his list \#2---the
requests currently being worked on---nice and short and he never made
commitments about the work on his list \#1---the work not yet
started---until he could reasonably do so. His customers knew that, and
given the scarcity of CORETRAN resources, accepted it. Limiting the
number of requests on list \#2 limited his work in process, which was
very much like working in small batches.

I listened as Catherine continued talking, describing how the system
would grow feature upon feature upon feature.

And then the most important piece of the jigsaw revealed itself from
across the room; the piece that helped me see the whole picture. A
newspaper, neatly folded and sitting on the edge of a couch, with the
front page headline clearly above the fold. \"More Factories Close: Can
Jobs Blow be Reversed?\" I didn\'t need to read the rest of the article
to know what it was about. That was the clever way reporters wrote
articles. They put the most important stuff at the top, and then the
next most important and then the next. It gave them and their editors
huge flexibility.

I thanked Catherine for her time. She asked me why I was suddenly asking
all these questions. Had I known Hal was going to pull the rug out on us
like that? Was there a problem she should know about? How many days had
I been working on the new plan?

I told her I would explain everything the following day. Or maybe the
day after that. I hung up and went into the lounge and stood beside my
bookcase. I needed to find a book.

Moments later, Mom arrived carrying a small plate of cheese and nuts, in
case I was still hungry. She stood behind me. \"What are you looking
for?\"

\"A book.\"

\"What book?\"

\"A book about marketing and communications. It\'s important.\"

I ran my hand along the books on the first shelf of the bookcase. It
wasn\'t there.

Mom asked me if I\'d like some cheese. I said that I would, maybe, in a
few minutes.

I checked the second shelf.

\"Some nuts, then?\"

\"Maybe later.\" I scanned the third shelf. Plenty of books, but not the
one I wanted.

\"I may take a lover. Perhaps two,\" Mom said.

\"Uh-hum,\" I said. How could it not be here? I checked the next two
shelves, touching each book.

\"Younger men, with stamina.\"

Okay, I heard that all right. I stopped thinking and gave her my full
attention.

\"What?\"

\"What\'s the book called?\" she smiled. She knew she had me.

\"It\'s called *Made to Stick*. It\'s got a story in it about the
telegraph system.\"

\"Is it in the attic?\"

I paused, then dashed up the stairs to the landing.

I heard Mom follow me up the stairs. I reached up and turned the attic
trapdoor latch open with my fingertips, then carefully let the door drop
open.

\"Is something wrong?\"

\"Nothing\'s wrong. Trust me. Everything is about to fall into place.\"

She frowned, not understanding.

I spoke with hands emphasizing the important bits. \"Look, Ron\'s team
works on lots of little projects. He ships new software several times
each month. He\'s got three lists, each made up of different
requests---bug fixes, small and medium sized enhancements---and they
deliver a constant stream of filled requests. Every few days, *bam!*
Another request shipped. Start the next one. Then a few days
later---*bam!*---another one.\"

She clearly wasn\'t keeping up with my explanation, but I kept going
anyway. I needed to hear the words spoken out loud to sanity-check them.
\"And then, when the FPP thing happened, Ron said he could change his
release dates just like that, without any hassle. His team is so much
more nimble, more responsive than all my other project teams.

\"And how come he can work that way and we can\'t? Because his workload
is made up of loads of small requests. His team completes each request,
tests the arse off it, makes sure they haven\'t broken anything and then
release it. Sometimes they release just one request at a time, sometimes
they batch up several requests---it all depends on what makes sense. But
they never do big batches, never.\" My hands were flying all over the
place.

I stopped. \"You see?\"

She said, \"I don\'t like it when you say the word arse, Steven.\"

Well, at least she was listening. I apologized, then stood on my tiptoes
and reached for the attic ladder.

Mom asked me to be careful, otherwise I\'d wake the kids.

I nodded and carefully pulled the ladder down to its full height. It
clicked into place.

\"But with FPP, it\'s a big project right? It\'s not made up of loads of
little requests, right? Or, at least, that\'s what we thought. We
thought we couldn\'t do what Ron does. That\'s what we thought. But we
can. At least I think we can. Do you see?\"

\"I haven\'t got a clue what you are talking about. Just don\'t wake the
kids. They\'ll be grumpy in the morning, otherwise.\"

\"Okay. Look, there\'s a book in the attic. It\'s about marketing and it
has a bit in it about journalism. It\'ll make things clearer.\"

\"Journalism?\"

Sometimes I worried that my mother didn\'t understand me. Perhaps it was
a generational thing. Perhaps it was because I was speaking gibberish.

I climbed up into the attic and turned on the light. In the far corner I
saw a pile of cardboard boxes full of old books. I carefully made my way
across the attic, dodging two old PCs, an ancient VCR, a broken-down
printer and several vacuum-packed plastic bags full of old baby clothes,
until I reached the boxes. I rooted around in them until I found the
book I was looking for.

When I picked my way back through the junk and back down the ladder, Mom
was still there, watching me. Perhaps to make sure I didn\'t start
reading too loudly and wake the kids. I flipped through the pages and
almost immediately found what I wanted.

That was when I had what I would later realize was my own French Fry
Revelation.

Except it was probably more geographically accurate to call it my
Egyptian Revelation.

I knew I would need Craig\'s help to round out the details of my
solution. I\'d need Phil\'s help, and Ron\'s too, to fine-tune it.

I turned the page towards Mom and smiled at her. \"There it is: the
inverted pyramid.\"
