Chapter 17
==========

Cheryl glanced sideways at Craig. \"Craig booked lunch with my old boss
and me here in the canteen and told us our food tasted horrible,\" She
turned to Craig. \"You can be awfully blunt sometimes, can\'t you?\"

He smiled and she continued with her story. \"My boss, a big opinionated
lady from Dundee, told Craig to go screw himself. She didn\'t come in
the next day, and I was offered to take on her job.\"

\"On one condition,\" smiled Craig. \"One horrifying condition.\"

Cheryl sighed, as if the memory of the horror was still fresh with her.
\"Craig insisted we ate the same food we served our customers. If we
did, he said, he\'d give us permission to change how we worked and
improve the food, so that we all got to keep our jobs and Wyxcomb
pensions. And eventually we could even have nice lunches every day.\"

\"Why on earth would Craig have to give you *permission* to improve?\"

Craig said, \"Over the years, the cafeteria staffs\' jobs had been
dumbed-down and standardized to the point where they were meant to be
idiot-proof.\"

\"Idiot-proof!\" Cheryl spat the words out like they were poison. \"Our
bosses thought we were idiots because we didn\'t wear suits to work. But
what we achieved here since then, after we started breaking their
idiot-proof rules, proved them wrong.\"

I glanced at Craig. He was nodding enthusiastically. I, on the other
hand, was struggling to see how this was relevant to me.

\"Could you show me some of your improvements?\"

Cheryl nodded, then led us to a couple of soup-warmer pots. One was
labeled Tomato Soup, the other Thai Chicken Noodle Soup.

\"These are called soup kettles. Soup is cheap, easy to cook and hard to
screw up. If the stock and the other ingredients are good, then the
soup\'s good. But, crazy as this sounds, our soup often tasted horrible.
You want to know why?\"

\"Of course.\"

\"No one ever tasted it before serving it.\"

\"Pardon?\"

\"No one ever tasted it before serving it.\"

\"No way.\"

\"Yes way, Steve. We cooked food, from scratch, following supposedly
\'foolproof\' recipes and menus provided to us by Head Office. We
followed the recipes to the letter, but no one tested them to see how
they tasted!\"

She stopped talking again and stared at me. I realized I was supposed to
ask her why no one ever tasted the soup. I obliged.

\"Why not?\"

\"Well, I\'m embarrassed to admit it now, but---frankly---we didn\'t
care.\" She shrugged her shoulders with indifference. \"We sold basic
food, which we cooked by following basic, foolproof recipes. It\'s not
like we were professional chefs chosen for our cooking skills; we were
chosen for our ability to follow simple instructions and not ask too
many questions. None of us ate the food we sold and none of us
particularly cared about the food we sold. We worked our hours, what
more could you ask from us?\"

I looked around the kitchen, and everyone seemed to be engaged and
working hard. I couldn\'t match what she was describing with what I saw.

\"What changed?\"

\"By threatening to outsource our jobs, our bosses gave us a reason to
worry and to change. By insisting we eat our own food, Craig gave us a
reason to care about our product.\"

I nodded.

\"Can you guess what the first change was?\"

That wasn\'t hard. \"Did you start tasting your food before you served
it?\"

She smiled and nodded. \"Yup. And often we fixed things with a little
salt or some pepper. Sometimes it was a little trickier. If we couldn\'t
fix it, we threw away the food.\"

I flinched. \"Ouch. Wasn\'t that expensive?\"

Craig said, \"Not as expensive as having not enough customers.\"

\"And that was just the first stopgap step.\" She looked at Craig. \"You
had a name for what we did next, but I can never remember what it is.\"

He said, \"You moved from late inspections---testing or tasting at the
end of the process when it\'s very expensive to fix stuff---to
in-process inspections, where you build quality into your product during
the process.\"

Cheryl nodded emphatically. \"Okay, Steve. Here\'s what in-process
inspections meant for us when cooking soup. It meant we checked the
ingredients were up to standards before using them. So we\'d taste the
stock before we put it into the soup kettle. You don\'t want to use bad
stock, cook the soup in it for hours, and then taste it and throw it
out.\"

I nodded. That was just common sense. \"And, I guess, you\'d check the
meat and vegetables were up to standards too, before you put them in.
That\'s what I\'d do if I was cooking soup at home.\"

\"Of course you would. You\'d check the raw ingredients were good.
You\'d taste and smell things. You\'d test them to see if they\'re
cooked.\"

\"Right.\"

\"At first we worried all that extra testing and tasting would take us a
lot of time, time we didn\'t have. But it didn\'t and it still
doesn\'t.\"

Craig added, \"Especially when the alternative was tossing product then
cooking a new batch of soup from scratch.\"

She folded her arms in front of her. \"Within two weeks, we\'d
transformed the quality of our food. And that was the first time I truly
enjoyed working here.\" She pointed to some of her team on the other
side of the room, putting fresh flowers on the dining tables. \"I
wasn\'t the only one.\"

I glanced at my watch again, then pulled my phone from my pocket and
checked its screen. I had twenty-one new emails and three missed calls.
I forced a smile and said to Cheryl: \"That\'s a nice story.\" I meant
it, but I guess maybe I didn\'t sound like I meant it enough.

Cheryl\'s smile dropped into a deep frown. \"It\'s more than nice. It\'s
a bloody miracle. They were going to shut us down, but with a few tweaks
over a few weeks, Craig saved our jobs\"

She looked at Craig, frowned, and said rather bluntly. \"Looks like
we\'ve got another skeptic here.\"

He smiled gently. \"Steve and I are still in the early stages of our
discussions.\"

I didn\'t like the way they\'d suddenly taken to speaking about me as if
I wasn\'t there. I took a small step back. \"You know,\" I said
defensively, \"my staff already does extensive in-process inspections
throughout our entire development process.\"

Cheryl said, \"Oh?\"

\"We inspect our requirements documents, our design documents and our
specification documents. And, we have very strict code inspection and
walkthrough processes. We\'re a big company, we have big processes
mandated on us from HQ, and we follow them to the letter. We don\'t cut
corners.\"

Craig said, \"These inspections, are they like looking at the soup or
like tasting it?\"

\"Looking or tasting? What do you mean?\"

\"Are you inspecting---*looking*--- at words and code, or are you
testing---*tasting*---that the software actually acts as you expect? The
former is inspection, the latter is testing.\"

\"Both. We do a lot of inspection, and our developers also extensively
test the software they write as they build it. They even automate some
of that testing."

"Wyx-Health didn\'t mention any of those things."

"I wouldn\'t expect them to. Given how you described them, they weren\'t
doing big projects like us, they were making small fixes and
enhancements to an old legacy system."

Suddenly he didn\'t look as confident as he had a few minutes earlier.
\"So you inspect and test during your development phase, but then,
despite that, you still require a long testing phase afterwards?\"

I nodded.

Cheryl surprised me by asking the next question. "How long does your
testing phase last, Steve?"

I frowned. "It depends. On medium to large projects we\'d typically
spend thirty percent, or more, of each project in the testing phase."

"And during that phase you are both testing and reworking?"

I nodded.

Cheryl then let out a long whistle. "No way. Really? You spend thirty
percent of your time fixing broken stuff?"

I glared at her, deciding then that I didn\'t like her, and that I\'d
spent enough time in her kitchen. I turned to Craig and blocked her from
my view. \"Can we speak in private?\"

He frowned, realizing, I guess, that he\'d lost me. \"I suppose.\"

I turned back to Cheryl. \"Thank you for your time, Cheryl.\" I smiled,
and I meant it. \"And thank you not just for now, but for saving the
cafeteria. The food, the service, they\'re much better now than they
were. Much better. And now I know why.\"

She smiled and thanked me, then dropped the smile and said sternly,
\"You do realize that you haven\'t heard the full story yet? You need to
hear about our French Fry Revelation before it fully makes sense.\"

\"I don\'t have time,\" I said softly.

She made a face, as if she\'d smelled something bad. \"We\'ll see,\" she
said, and then walked off without saying goodbye.

Craig sighed. \"Let\'s go talk.\"
