Chapter 16
==========

Craig waved to one of the servers. \"How you doing, Randall?\" he said.

Randall, a burly guy wearing the cafeteria staff\'s ninja-style black
uniform and a black chef\'s hat, sliced through the strings on a roasted
beef joint with a large carving knife.

\"Aye, I\'m grand, Craig. Thank you for asking. Cheryl is in the
kitchen. She\'s expecting you.\"

Craig led me into the kitchen, then waved at a thin, short, middle-aged
woman carrying a clipboard and pacing while talking on a portable phone.
I guessed she was Cheryl.

Spotting Craig, she smiled broadly and mouthed *two minutes*. She waved
us towards a small office. I listened as we passed her. It sounded like
she was making the following day\'s vegetable order.

While we sat waiting in the office, Craig said, \"Like I said, my new
TCQ boss wanted me to help outsource the cafeteria operations. But since
many of my friends had just lost their jobs offshore, I didn\'t like
that idea. Instead, I helped the cafeteria team turn around their
operation so that it no longer made sense to outsource them. It was easy
for me---the kitchen is just a small factory---but not so easy for
them.\"

He paused to let that last sentence sink in.

\"The cafeteria suffered two classic manufacturing problems: a flow
problem, which the cafeteria staff named their French Fry Revelation,
and a quality problem they call their Dog Food Problem. Both were
interrelated.\"

\"Strange names.\"

\"Sometimes it helps to name new concepts, especially if you pick a
sticky name. The concepts are straightforward. Cheryl will explain.\"

Cheryl arrived and Craig stood up to greet her. They hugged, then Cheryl
turned to me and stuck out her hand. \"I\'m Cheryl. I manage this place.
You must be Steve.\"

I said, \"I am,\" and we shook hands. She had a strong grip for such a
tiny lady.

\"Craig says you\'re one of those clever computer whiz kids from
upstairs.\"

I nodded.

\"And that you\'ve got yourself in a bit of a mess and you need old
Cheryl to show you how to sort it out?\"

I felt my face redden, but I nodded. \"Something like that.\"

\"Good. First, can you take off your tie, please?\"

\"Of course.\" I imagined my tie being sucked into a pasta machine,
turning it and then me into tagliatelle. \"Is it a safety hazard?\"

\"No, it\'s because you look like a dork.\"

She said it in such a nice way that I did as I was told. I even smiled a
little.

Cheryl led me on a quick tour of the kitchen, starting at the back door
where the fresh ingredients were dropped each morning. We popped into a
walk-in chiller then quickly back out again (it was cold). She pointed
out the various jobs her team was performing as they prepared for the
upcoming lunchtime rush. I saw a lot of chopping, stirring and cleaning.
I smelled a bundle of pleasing odors, the sweet-savory smell of onions
frying dominating. She trotted to the swinging doors that separated the
kitchen from the serving area and pushed one open. \"We serve hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of meals each day. I\'ve seen you in the queue,
Steve, so you know how it works.\"

I said I did and that I recognized her, too. She seemed happy about
that.

Cheryl turned to Craig. \"Shall I tell Steve about our miracle
turnaround, then?\"

Craig tilted his head from side to side, as if wondering if that was a
good idea, then nodded emphatically, as if he\'d just made a profoundly
important decision. \"Why not?\"

I glanced at my watch. My self-imposed ten minute limit was almost up,
but I decided to hang around a little longer. It couldn\'t hurt, and I
didn\'t want to seem impolite to Cheryl. She seemed like a nice lady.
And she prepared most of my lunches.

\"Come through here,\" Cheryl said as she led us out through the
swinging doors to stand beside the serving area. Randall had gone,
leaving the roasted beef and a pork roast, complete with gravy, resting
under the heating lamps for the call center staff whose shifts forced
them to take their lunch earlier than most.

She asked me how long I\'d been working at Wyx-Fin. I told her I\'d
spent nineteen years within the Wyxcomb Group. She called me a newbie.
She\'d worked in the canteen for twenty-eight years.

\"So,\" she said, \"up until about three years ago our food was barely
fit for human consumption. You wouldn\'t feed it to a dog. Well, not a
posh dog; a stray would eat it if there were no alternatives. We called
this our Dog Food problem.

\"Our bosses said our food cost too much and that our customers hated
it. They wanted to lay us off and replace us with a commercial catering
operation. They were right about the problem, wrong about the cure.\"

She pointed to Craig. \"That\'s when Craig turned up and forced us to
eat our own dog food.\"

Craig smiled, managing to look both proud and modest at the same time.

\"He spent two weeks with us, and with only one change in staff and no
changes in our food suppliers, we were soon cooking food our customers
liked. Now, as I\'m sure you know, nothing travels faster than word of
good quality, affordable food within walking distance. After a month, we
were serving nearly twice as many customers as before, our average costs
dropped way down, and the threat to replace us disappeared.

\"Would you like to hear how that happened?\"

I said I would. It was hard to say otherwise.
