Chapter 61
==========

Saturday, November 18th

I woke late the following morning, instantly regretting that I\'d agreed
to join Phil and Gregor and Vrinda and Tim and a half dozen others for
just one pint after FPP\'s disco officially wrapped up last night.

Just one! Hah! Was there actually such a thing?

We\'d started with a couple of pints of Guinness at The Burns Unit, then
ambled down to High Street for an Indian, which we washed down with
Kingfisher beer. Then, if I recall correctly, we fit in some black
Russians before calling it an evening. I got a cab home sometime between
midnight and sunrise and then slept until just after ten, when I finally
forced myself out of bed, into the shower and down the stairs.

Alison was in the lounge watching cartoons under two dining chairs she
had covered in rugs to make a den. I could hear Mum next door in the
kitchen. Alison saw me and rushed over for hug. I crouched down---with
difficulty---and told her I\'d trade for a kiss. She leaned in and then,
with the brutal honesty only a four-year-old girl can command, said,
\"Your breath stinks, Daddy.\"

I kissed her anyway, then tickled her to change the subject. \"Where is
Ashley?\"

\"Playing with friends out on the green.\"

\"Did she take a jacket with her?\"

\"Maybe.\"

I screwed up my face. It was mid-November in Scotland, but my kids and
their friends seemed impervious to the cold, and in fact believed they
had an inalienable right to bare arms.

\"What you watching?\"

\"Scooby-Doo.\"

I glanced at the TV. \"I\'ve seen this one before. Is this the one
where, right at the end, they discover the monster isn\'t really a
monster, it\'s just someone dressed up like a monster?\"

She looked at me and scrunched up her little nose. \"Yeaah. They\'re all
like that, Dad.\"

I went through to the kitchen. Mum was standing at the kitchen bench,
her reading glasses on, doing The Times crossword.

She took one look at me, said, \"My poor boy,\" and started preparing me
a bacon sandwich, whether I wanted one or not.

While the bacon sizzled, she said, \"You\'re far too old for these late
nights.\"

\"I got a promotion yesterday,\" I said, grinning despite myself. I had
hoped to build up some tension and make a dramatic announcement, but I
was just too excited to wait.

She smiled. \"So you were celebrating?\"

\"Oh yes! Yesterday was maybe the best day of my career ever, Mom!\"

\"Do tell.\"

So I told. I stood there in the doorway of my tiny kitchen and told her
the first part of my story while she stood at the counter, listening,
turning the bacon and nodding in all the right places. I\'d reached the
bit where I called Norbert just as she finished slicing the finished
sandwiches in half diagonally, which is how I liked them when I was a
kid.

She popped the sandwiches on a plate and said, \"Does this mean your
travel is going to increase?\" She looked pained by the thought.

\"No.\"

\"But you will have to travel after the summer next year?\"

\"No.\"

\"No travel?" She looked confused. "Tell me then, clever clogs, how did
you manage to get this promotion but not travel?\"

I picked up my sandwich and took a tentative bite. The butter and the
salt, the soft, soft bread and the crunch of the bacon, all mixed
together with the ketchup\'s sharp sweetness were, at that moment, the
best thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life. Ever.

\"Mmmm. This is so good.\"

\"Steven?\"

I put the sandwich down, then smiled. "I brokered a deal between
Norbert, Eleanor and Halifax. I will stay in Watt\'s Bridge, doing my
utmost to ensure Future Perfect is a commercial success. As well as
that, my team and I will use Wyx-Fin to figure out how to invert
projects from the start. That\'s good for Wyx-Fin and for the Group.\"

She nodded. "It\'s good provided Future Perfect succeeds---but that
isn\'t guaranteed.\"

\"Future Perfect is my number one priority. But, assuming it goes well,
then Norbert wants me to teach people in his other subsidiaries how to
invert their projects. When that happens, I\'ve told him that they can
fork out for the airfares and fly to me. He\'s very happy with that.\"

She clapped her hands together. \"Wonderful! Hal and Eleanor get what
they want. You get the job you\'ve always wanted. Norbert gets what he
wants.\"

I looked out the window and noticed Alison and Ashley were playing
together in the back yard. I watched them for a moment, then took
another bite of my sandwich. I really did love the taste of bacon, but
if I ever had to, I thought I could live without it.

I said, \"And, best of all, I get to spend more time at home, with you
and the kids.\"

She looked down at her hands, then back up to me. \"Fran would be proud
of you.\"

That was the best thing anyone could ever say to me.
