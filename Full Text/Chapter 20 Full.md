Chapter 20
==========

The pub\'s official name was The Robbie Burns, after Scotland\'s great
poet, but we locals called it The Burns Unit, since it was right next to
Watt\'s Bridge hospital. It was frequented by hospital staff as well as
by people from the nearby offices. There had been much loose talk of
renaming it since the smoking ban, but the talk had come to nothing.

It took me five minutes of fast walking to get to the pub. I felt myself
get angrier with each footstep. When I got there, I was ready to kick
each of their arses a dozen times over.

The pub was dimly lit. Abba\'s \"Dancing Queen\" played over the sound
system; very traditional. From the looks on their faces when I walked
in, I\'d guess they were expecting Gregor, not me. Perhaps forty of my
staff, almost all of the permies working on the core FPP team, sat in
the far corner. Most of them were positioned with a view of the door and
all looked like they were drinking freshly-squeezed lemon juice. Big
Declan McGuiness, the employee rep, sat among the group. He was
frowning, but that wasn\'t so unusual. My heart sunk when I saw Phil and
Vrinda sitting with them as well.

Apart from a few medics spread about the pub, this could have been a
Wyx-Fin meeting room.

I caught Vrinda\'s eye, and she held my gaze in defiance until I
conceded by tilting my head towards an empty corner of the pub. She
followed my gaze and looked back at Phil, who nodded. We met in the
corner next to the dart board. It had three darts sticking out of the
bullseye, each at an unnatural angle like someone had pushed them there
rather than thrown them.

\"What\'s happening?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

\"I tried to warn you, but you ignored me,\" Vrinda said. She spoke
quietly, which I knew meant that she was angry. Unlike most of the
crowd, she held a mug of tea.

I glanced at Phil\'s pint glass. I couldn\'t judge whether it was
half-empty or half-full. With the subtlest of movement from his left
eyebrow and the merest hint from his right, he asked me silently if I
wanted one. With a barely perceptible tilt of my head, I thanked him but
declined with regret.

Vrinda said, \"Gregor cancelled everyone\'s holidays---holidays we\'d
already rescheduled to suit the project\'s previous schedule. Then he
told a few of us, myself included, to pull up our socks and work more
overtime. I already take work home. I have children. He can shove it.\"

Phil said, \"Steve, we\'re not out to screw you.\"

\"I know that,\" I said, half wishing I\'d accepted his offer of a pint.
\"But if not me, then who are you trying to screw?\"

They said nothing. We all knew Gregor was their bad guy. But didn\'t
they realize that by screwing him, they were screwing me?

Gregor was in a horrible position, and I\'d have done exactly the same
if I were him. What else could he do?

\"You could try giving Gregor a break,\" I said. \"He\'s had to make
some very difficult calls.\"

I didn\'t say it, but I couldn\'t help but think it: A few longer hours
every so often in times of crisis wasn\'t all that much to ask for. Most
of the people in this pub had low-rate staff mortgages with Wyx-Fin Bank
that were paid straight out of their relatively generous Wyx-Fin salary.

\"Look,\" Phil said, putting his pint glass down on the table and
leaning over to pull the darts from the board. \"Gregor\'s made zero
friends in the two years since he started working with us. We\'re all
just utterly, utterly sick of working our butts off at the end of every
project because your managers can\'t manage their dates properly.\"

Phil stepped back from the dart board and took aim. Vrinda and I quickly
moved out of his way.

He said, \"It\'s the same pattern in every project: a desperate mad dash
at the end that we---and our families---bear the brunt of.\" He threw
his first dart; it hit the board, bounced off, and landed on the floor.
As he crouched down to pick it up, he said, \"The bottom line is that we
are not working impossible hours for the next four months for some
futile date.\"

\"Futile? It\'s not futile, Phil. It\'s very important that we make this
date. Vital.\"

He turned and gestured at his colleagues on the other side of the room.
I looked across at them. Apart from Declan, who raised his pint towards
me, they all averted their gaze. I understood; Phil was speaking for
everyone.

Phil said, \"I didn\'t say FPP wasn\'t important, Steve. I said it was
futile. Two different concepts. I\'ll buy you a dictionary for your
birthday and you can look them up. Point is, none of us believe we\'ll
make February 1st. And none of us believed we\'d make the original date
either.\"

I nodded.

He looked down, breaking eye contact. \"I spoke to Ron about it. He
more-or-less agreed.\"

I spun to check the far side of the room. If Ron was among the mutineers
then this little get-together wasn\'t a mutiny, it was a wake, and my
best move would be to buy a round of pints and join in the drinking. I
scanned the room but, thankfully, Ron wasn\'t there.

Phil said, \"And now Gregor asks us to work compulsory overtime. Time in
the office doesn\'t correlate with productivity. \"

\"Now, come on a minute,\" I protested.

\"Sure, we get a short burst of productivity, but it soon drops away
when we get tired. And then we get sick and tired. And then we just get
sick.\" He cleared his throat. \"There\'s a huge difference between
staying late when I feel I can make a difference and working late in
order to cover some manager\'s butt. And that\'s all this is.\"

\"You think this is a butt-covering exercise?\"

He took his time aiming, then threw another dart. It hit the board and
stuck this time, just shy of the bullseye.

\"If we work our butts off, then how can anyone say that we didn\'t put
our backs into it? How can they blame any of us---especially the
PM---when it was obviously an impossible, *futile* date?\"

I shook my head. There was that word again. I agreed with everything
they said. But that was the game we played.

\"What do you want me to do?\"

Vrinda answered without hesitation. \"One, rescind Gregor\'s overtime
and vacation demands. Two, replace Gregor with someone we respect.
Three, let us finish the project properly without artificial pressure.\"

I bit my lip and looked at my two friends. I needed them on board more
than anyone else. But I couldn\'t replace Gregor even if it might make
some people happier in the short term. He wasn\'t here to make friends,
and I had no one else who could do his job.

Then I took a gamble. Unlike Gregor, I *had* made friends. I gestured to
an empty booth and asked them to sit down. Phil walked up to the dart
board and stuck the remaining dart firmly in the bullseye, then slid in
after Vrinda. I sat opposite, then lowered my voice and asked them if
they could keep a secret. They both nodded, their faces a mix of
curiosity and concern.

\"Hal\'s making an announcement later today and Eleanor wouldn\'t tell
me what it\'s about.\"

Phil said, \"Well, if you don\'t know what it\'s about how can you tell
us? That\'s not a very good secret.\"

I shook my head. \"No, the secret announcement is not the secret I want
to tell you. There are two secrets. I need to tell you the second one.\"

\"Are you sure you don\'t want a pint? You\'re not making much sense
sober.\"

I ignored him. \"Hal just threatened my job.\"

Vrinda waved that away. \"He does that sort of thing all the time. He\'s
all bark and no bite. Everyone knows that.\"

I shook my head. \"No, this time is different. If FPP delivers late then
I, apparently, am out on my arse.\"

She winced. \"Ow. That\'s not a threat, it\'s an ultimatum.\"

\"Can he do that? Seriously?\" Phil asked.

I nodded.

Vrinda\'s face hardened. \"You need us to get back to work?\"

I nodded again.

She picked up her mug. \"I\'ll make you a deal, Steve. I\'ll get this
lot back to work, but in return there won\'t be any compulsory overtime.
You can do what you like with Gregor, but if you want to keep your job
and deliver on February 1st then we\'re going to have to slash even more
features from the product. And cross our fingers even tighter.\"

I shook my head. \"You honestly think there\'s more room to descope?\"

\"There is always more room to descope. Always.\"

I leaned forward. \"Okay. I\'ll talk Gregor down, but you can\'t tell
anyone about Hal\'s threat.\"

She stood. \"What do you think we are? Stupid?\"

Phil slid out of the booth to let Vrinda out, then slid back in as she
made her way over to join the rest of the group. I couldn\'t hear what
she said, but within minutes they had downed their drinks, gathered
their things and shuffled off to their desks. I watched as they left,
but none made eye contact with me. Not even Vrinda.

Phil smirked, \"How \'bout we get that pint after all?\"

I smiled ruefully and shook my head.

Phil shrugged. \"I\'ll call my mom tonight and ask her to pray for
you.\"

Phil was an atheist, so he got his mom to do his praying for him.

I liked that about him.
