Chapter 10
==========

Friday, August 4th

I returned to the FPP War Room at 3:55 the following afternoon, as
agreed.

The walls were covered with flip chart paper and Post-it notes, the
table with printouts and coffee cups. Gregor was busy typing, Vrinda was
doing nothing in particular except looking grumpy, and Catherine wasn\'t
there. Phil was busy snapping photographs of the walls using his phone.
A stack of empty pizza boxes sat at the back of the room. Lunch or last
night\'s dinner, I couldn\'t tell. I breathed in, and immediately wished
I hadn\'t. If work had an odor, then I guess you could say the room
smelled of work.

I placed a small box of cookies (made by Mom and the girls) on the
table, then went to the far side of the room and forced open a couple of
windows.

I asked Gregor if he had a plan.

He nodded. \"It\'s aggressive but, I think, workable. We have some very
busy months ahead of us, but we should make it.\"

I thought I saw Vrinda roll her eyes, but I wasn\'t sure.

Catherine returned and we all sat down. Gregor described how they\'d
come up with their plan. He said they\'d started with the spreadsheet
produced during their last descoping exercise earlier in the year. The
spreadsheet listed all FPP\'s features and ranked them as must-haves,
should-haves, could-haves and won\'t-have features. I\'d always
suspected Catherine had deliberately thrown in the won\'t-haves at the
start of the project, so we\'d have something to slash during the
descoping exercise that almost always happened later on. At the end of
the exercise last year, Catherine swore we\'d cut every ounce of fat
from her product, and some muscle as well.

Gregor snorted. \"If that earlier exercise was a gentle descoping, then
today\'s session was battlefield triage. We took far fewer prisoners
this time, Steve.\"

Clearly pleased with the results, Gregor explained his triage approach.
They had written every feature in the spreadsheet on its own little
yellow sticky note, then scattered the dozens of sticky notes randomly
across the breadth of the conference room\'s back wall. Then, they used
a divide-and-conquer approach to force-rank every feature.

It went like this: Gregor had chosen one sticky note at random, the
group had agreed it wasn\'t unusual in any way, and they placed it in
the middle of the wall. Gregor called it the pivot feature---like on a
set of old fashioned balancing scales. Then, one-by-one, they\'d taken
every other sticky note and asked if it was more or less valuable than
the pivot feature. The more valuable features got moved to the left side
of the wall, the less valuable to the right. The number of stickies
wasn\'t evenly balanced, but that didn\'t matter. They repeated the
process with the two halves until they\'d ended up with the most
important features, the must-must-haves*,* on the far left side of the
wall, the must-haves sitting next to them, and so on.

Gregor said, \"We paused at this stage to figure out what to do next. We
concluded there must be some absolute bare minimum set of must-have
features we needed before we can go live.

Catherine said, \"I decided where that point was on the wall. We marked
that point with the extra-large pink sticky note.\"

She pointed to the wall and I nodded, acknowledging the pink sticky
note\'s presence.

\"Okay.\" I went to the wall and scanned the sticky notes. They meant
little to me---I didn\'t need to know the details in order to do my
job---but I could see how, as I moved from left to right, the product
built up feature-by-feature until it hit the pink sticky note. Even I
could tell that the product truly was bare bones. Skeletal, even.

I was about to turn back to them when a horrible thought occurred to me.
I looked around the room to see if there was another bunch of stickies.
There wasn\'t.

I turned to Gregor. \"There\'s no web work here.\"

He nodded, the corners of his mouth turning down even more than usual.

\"You\'ve descoped the web app?\"

He nodded again.

I looked around the table, hoping one of my colleagues would burst out
laughing at the little joke they\'d played on me.

Silence.

I shook my head in disbelief. \"Seriously? We\'re launching without a
web app? People will laugh.\" I looked at Catherine. \"Can we do that?\"

She grimaced. \"Yes, we can. We will look lame, but on the plus side,
most sales will originate in our branches or, once we advertise, our
call center.\"

I looked back at Gregor.

He said, \"We don\'t have enough runway to launch with a web app by
February.\"

I closed my eyes for a moment and took in a calming breath. \"I\'m so
sorry, Catherine.\"

She shrugged. \"It\'s not your fault, Steve. You didn\'t change the
date. Circumstances did.\"

I turned to Gregor, and was pleased my voice stayed steady. That calming
breath thing really works. \"What did you do next?\"

\"Next,\" he said, \"we developed a brand new project plan to build this
bare minimum. We all agreed, by the way, that except for one exception
which we will discuss later, it would slow us down if we tried to bring
any new staff on to the project at this stage.\"

I nodded.

Gregor cleared his throat, as if he were about to make an announcement.
\"The new plan, to build up to the pink sticky, came in at just over
fifteen weeks\' work---most of it testing.\"

Catherine said, \"If we went live with only the bare bones features,
then our support processes would be a nightmare. We\'d be better going
live with spreadsheets. I needed those processes more than I needed a
web app.\"

\"I understand.\"

\"So,\" Gregor said, \"we added a few more really-really-should-have
features until we had a plan that takes six months, including two weeks
at the end for launch. Testing starts in five weeks.\"

I asked Catherine if she was happy with that.

\"Happy? No. But what choice do I have?\" She shook her head. \"If FPP
were a tricycle, maybe it would have three wheels and handlebars. But no
seat. It\'s going to be an uncomfortable ride, but I can live with it
until February, so long as we add the seat after that, in phase two.\"

She was right to assume that Eleanor and Mark had money ferreted away to
fund FPP until the end of the following year. So, yes, in theory she
would get her phase two. But realistically, we\'d spend much of phase
two fixing the stuff we got wrong in phase one. I decided to let her
figure that out in her own time.

I turned to Gregor. \"Are you confident you can achieve the date?\"

He didn\'t respond straightaway. I watched as his eyes seemed to search
for the answers somewhere near the back of his head, then he
straightened his back, took a deep breath, and said, \"Steve, it\'s an
aggressive schedule, but if you\'re happy to pay the overtime, then I am
confident it is achievable.\"

\"Good.\" That was the gung-ho attitude I liked to see.

He let a tiny smile sneak out. \"I\'ll announce compulsory paid overtime
on Monday and I\'ll ask everyone to voluntarily cancel any holidays they
have planned for the next six months. If I don\'t get enough volunteers,
I\'ll cancel vacations.\"

\"They\'ll hate you for that,\" Vrinda snapped at him. She\'d been
silent so far, which was unusual for her.

Gregor snapped back. \"You can\'t make an omelet without breaking a few
eggs, Vrinda. You do the analysis; I\'ll do the managing. We\'ll both be
a lot happier.\"

She grimaced. \"Yeah, right. A lot happier.\"

I intervened. \"Look. If you two kids can\'t play nicely together then
I\'ll send you to your rooms.\"

My words were light-hearted, my tone was not. I couldn\'t have the team
falling apart before we\'d even restarted the project. I looked each of
them in the eye and they both said sorry, though clearly neither meant
it. I changed the topic.

\"This is good work, everyone. I\'m pleased with what you\'ve done. Now,
what do you guys need from me?\"

Gregor said, \"We identified three obstacles for you to remove.\"

He turned to Tim, who said, \"The first is test data. Every project
I\'ve worked on here has been hobbled by the lack of good test data. \"

I nodded. That was true.

\"It\'s hard setting up test data,\" Tim continued. \"You need a broad
knowledge of our existing systems as well as knowledge of the new
application. The people who have that knowledge are considered too
valuable to spend their time creating test data. \"

\"What would you like me to do, Tim?\" I asked.

\"This is the area where we could add new staff to the project without
slowing everyone else down. We\'d like a dedicated team established to
set up test data. We need the team to be overstaffed so that they
respond quickly---in minutes rather than weeks---to requests for new
data. And, I\'d like them not to complain about it.\"

I smirked. He was doing well until the last sentence and he knew it. \"I
guarantee you that you\'ll have a dedicated, overstaffed team by the end
of next week.\" I\'d draw people in from the business, and Catherine and
Mark would pull a few strings if need be. \"But I can\'t guarantee they
won\'t complain. I\'m no miracle worker. What\'s the second obstacle?\"

Gregor said, \"Catherine and her team sit with us, and it\'s been great
having them so close when we have questions or issues. But we\'d also
like to have other customers, such as the actuaries and a representative
from the marketing and documents team, working directly with us. We\'d
also like some of the periphery IS teams moved in, too. In particular,
we\'d like at least two DBAs sitting here with us.\"

\"Good thinking,\" I said. I tried, with every project, to work as one
colocated team, but despite my good intentions, I almost always failed.
But FPP was different. It was corporate priority number one. If anyone
complained when I wanted to move them, I\'d threaten them with a call
from the personnel department. And if that didn\'t work, I\'d threaten
them with a personal call from Halifax Gibbet himself. \"I\'ll get
facilities on the transfers immediately. It\'ll be done by Wednesday.\"

\"In that case,\" interrupted Phil enthusiastically, \"can you get us an
FPP team espresso machine---a good one? This automatic dispensing
machine coffee gives me heartburn, the tea has stuff floating in it, and
it has whitener in it, not milk. It\'s a health risk.\"

He was, of course, being flippant. I said, \"Is that your third
obstacle?\"

\"No,\" Gregor stepped in. \"We need a large dedicated meeting room.
This conference room would be ideal. And we need whiteboards, plenty of
whiteboards. And a large stock of whiteboard marker pens; they\'re as
rare as hens\' teeth around here and I\'d hate to lose this battle for
want of a marker pen.\"

\"Done.\" I told them that Carol, my PA, had spent most of the morning
moving meetings around specifically to free up space.

\"As of today, this conference room is dedicated to FPP, as are three
smaller meeting rooms. I\'ll get Carol to check, each day, that the
meeting rooms are fully stocked with pens and other stationary.\"
Sometimes it\'s the small things that matter the most.

I straightened the papers in front of me then looked around the table,
making certain to catch everyone\'s eye.

\"Thanks, everyone. You\'ve done good work these last two days.\" I
stood. \"And now I want you all to go home and enjoy your weekends.
I\'ll see you all at Monday morning\'s team meeting.\"

As everyone stood, I caught Vrinda\'s eye and asked her quietly, \"Can
you walk with me?\"

She glanced at Gregor. He was packing papers into boxes and didn\'t look
in our direction.

Quietly---meekly, might be a better word---she said, \"Yes.\"
