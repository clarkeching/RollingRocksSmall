Chapter 7
=========

Vrinda reacted instantly. \"Oh great! Here we go again. Another
arbitrary date imposed on us from on high. Just what we need.\"

Catherine\'s response was slower and came in phases. At first she was
far more controlled than Vrinda. I saw her flinch when she heard about
the betrayal, but then, almost instantly, she assumed a poker face.
\"So, the only way we can possibly hit the date is by throwing away most
of the work we\'ve done? And lowering our quality standards?\"

I said, \"Something\'s gotta give.\"

She looked at Phil. \"Pauline really did this?\"

He nodded.

Catherine lowered her gaze towards the table. \"I do not know what to
say.\"

Vrinda reached across and patted Catherine on the back of her hand.
\"This really sucks.\"

Catherine jerked her head up and looked directly at me. \"I bet she
justified her betrayal by saying it wasn\'t personal, it was just
business.\"

I nodded. It sure felt personal.

I gave everyone a few minutes more to react to the new information, to
vent. I also knew they understood the February 1st date was,
effectively, set in stone so there was no point bitching about it.

I was tired and I needed them to get on with things.

\"I\'ve booked this conference room for the rest of today and all of
tomorrow. I\'ll leave shortly and then return at four p.m. tomorrow.
When I return I want you, Gregor, to present me with a detailed recovery
plan to deliver the first release of FPP in just over twenty-four
weeks\' time. Okay?\"

Gregor said, \"Of course,\" and everyone else nodded.

I nodded back. \"I want you all to keep four things in mind.\"

\"First, you have to deliver a complete, saleable product on this date.
It\'s not just a software development problem. Marketing have to do
their stuff. And Catherine, I know you know this, but you need to set up
your call center and rollout the product across the entire organization
by February 1st.\"

Catherine nodded, still looking a bit shell-shocked.

\"Second. We cannot deliver eight months\' work in six months. You will
have to cut the product drastically. Catherine, your job here as
customer rep is to ensure the product has the features necessary and
sufficient to go live, but no more. Gregor, your job is to ensure we
meet the date. We cannot and will not miss the February deadline.

\"Third, you all know this is Wyx-Fin\'s number-one priority project. If
anything gets in your way, then tell me and I\'ll move it. Gregor, I\'ll
need a list on Friday. Plan your schedule accordingly.

\"And finally, I hate to say this, but quality is negotiable---to a
point. This baby will be born premature. The delivery will be difficult
and we will have to nurse it into good health long after February 1st.\"

I looked at Tim. \"We will ship a shoddy product, but I cannot tolerate
a dangerous product. I need you to adopt a risk-based approach to your
testing.\"

I turned to Catherine. \"And Catherine, come February 1st, the product
will contain a large number of known and unknown defects. We will do our
best, but you or Mark will need to make the final call about whether we
go live or not. Okay?\"

Her forehead furrowed as she considered the implications. She clearly
wasn\'t happy, but what choice did she have?

\"Okay,\" she said. At least she now had plenty to focus on besides
Pauline\'s betrayal.

\"Good,\" I said. I pushed my chair back from the table, then put on my
grandest voice. \"This conference room is officially a War Room.\"
