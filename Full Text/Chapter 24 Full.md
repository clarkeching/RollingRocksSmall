Chapter 24
==========

I met Craig in the cafeteria\'s dining area. Apart from a few folk
meeting around tables the cafeteria was empty. It would be busier later
when the evening shift call center workers came in early for their
pre-work, subsidized dinners.

I shook Craig\'s hand briskly, then dropped the FPP folder on the coffee
table with a *thunk* and asked him if he wanted some green tea.

\"We don\'t have time.\" He gestured towards the seat across from him.
\"Norbert confirmed your job is at risk.\"

I nodded. What else could I say?

He placed his phone on the table. \"He said that if you walked out on me
this time, then I should ask you to call him.\"

\"What?\"

\"He said he will fly here and take over your job.\"

I flinched. \"He couldn\'t do my job.\"

Craig shrugged, then---having passed on Norbert\'s message---changed
topic. \"My son gets married this weekend. The wedding rehearsal is this
evening. My family has flown in from around the world and I\'m on
vacation for the next three weeks. So your timing, from your point of
view, sucks. From my point of view, I\'m on holiday for three weeks.\"

I could feel the noose tighten around my neck. Out of politeness, I
added, \"Congratulations. We should get started then.\"

\"Excellent!\" he boomed. He stood. \"Leave your folder there. Follow
me.\"

We started walking towards the kitchen and he said, \"There\'s just one
rule I want you to follow.\"

\"What\'s that?\"

\"Do not think about small batches. Okay?\"

\"Small what?\"

\"Batches. Don\'t think about them.\"
