Chapter 31
==========

Mom and I had a deal: She cooked, I cleaned. She was good at cooking and
I was not; she didn\'t like cleaning up and I enjoyed it. And our home,
while big enough for us, was old. Some parts of it---like the
kitchen---were tiny, and there was only room to fit one person at a time
comfortably.

I cleared the table then flipped through the radio until it played a
song I recognized.

I went back to the sink and started scrubbing away on the evening\'s
dishes. Within moments I\'d switched into autopilot, freeing my mind to
play back my very busy day. The day had started well, then deteriorated
into a mutiny and ended up with a most unusual tour of the staff
cafeteria.

And, unless I pulled off a miracle, I wouldn\'t have a job in a few
months.

Not your typical day at the office.

I\'d also been assigned homework---something that hadn\'t happened in
nearly twenty years. Best get on with that ...

The hands were simple: On the one hand, we should build as many features
as possible from the requirements document, even though many were of
disputable value; on the other hand, we should only build the highest
value features---those that were indisputably required. I figured out
the shoulders easily enough, without needing to list pros and cons:
Build the best product and deliver to the best schedule. I decided the
head of the cloud should be *A Successful Business*.

I stopped washing for a moment and spoke the conflict out loud.

\"In order to have a successful business, we must build the best
product. In order to build the best product, we must build many
features."

\"In order to have a successful business, we must deliver to the best
schedule. In order to deliver on the best schedule we must build only
the highest value features.\"

It felt like it hung together, and I noticed how closely this conflict
resembled those on the change request cloud---the head and shoulders
were the same, but the hands differed. In both cases we wanted the best
product and the best schedule. But because we had set out to build a big
product with no real idea of how long it would take, we had achieved
neither.

Like most things in the kitchen, the dish rack was small, and so it was
soon full. I grabbed a fresh dish towel and quickly did the drying, then
started washing again.

I considered where to go next with the cloud diagram, and I remembered
that Wyx-Health had tackled their outsourcing cloud by listing the pros
and cons and then challenging them, either by showing that they were
invalid, or by changing things so they were invalid. I\'d skipped
listing the pros and cons and jumped straight to the conflict\'s
shoulders, so I decided to go back and do them, starting with the small
product/short schedule side of the cloud.

I considered the statement: In order to deliver to the best schedule we
must build only the highest value features

What were the pros of delivering a small product? It was easier to
build, easier to test, and simpler to use. You got to market faster and
pulled revenue in sooner. And I often preferred buying simpler products
because they were easier to understand. In business terms, that must
mean they were occasionally easier to sell (yet another pro), though not
always. That wasn\'t the Wyx-Fin way, but wasn\'t Chaste\'s approach
based around that idea?

I thought it interesting that some of the pros weren\'t just about the
schedule. They also concerned the product and the flow of benefits. So
the full benefit would be the ability to deliver a better product,
sooner.

Sticking with the same side of the cloud, I considered the cons of the
opposite hand: including many features in the product

There were many. We would build big, bloated products, full of features
no one wanted. Those products would be hard to support, and while our
projects lasted months and years, our products lasted decades, so big
products were expensive to own.

Then I ran back over the list I had just made. Were there any invalid
pros or cons, or any that I could somehow make invalid?

I couldn\'t find anything. There were a lot of benefits of building
smaller products, those with only the highest value features and that
would get to market sooner. That fit with my intuition that I\'d get
more leverage blitzing the other arm---the one that included all the
requirements. But then again, the Wyx-Health solution had been contrary
to my intuition. And how on earth did we figure out exactly what those
highest value features were? Time to look at the cloud\'s other arm.

In order to build the best product, we must include as many features as
possible, even if some were of disputable value.

What were the pros?

This was harder for me to figure out. I tried putting myself in
Catherine\'s shoes. Why would she say something was required when it
wasn\'t? Simple answer: because it might be, but she didn\'t know yet.
If she didn\'t include it, but realized later she needed it, the only
way she had to get it was to submit a change request and then do a lot
of formalized begging. Odds of getting the change request approved?
Lowish. It was easier for her to chuck everything in she could think of
and claim they were all of high value, because she didn\'t know which
features actually were.

So pro number one was: Features of uncertain value are more likely to be
built. (But so are features of low-value).

Often, some lesser value requirements are left out in the first phase
with the assurances to the customer that they will be added in during
phase two, when we know more. That was a gap-filling approach: Build
something, ship it, figure out what the important gaps were, then fill
them in phase two.

But the odds of actually getting a phase two? Very low. Phase two was
normally used to fix bugs which either weren\'t found or weren\'t fixed
during the testing phase.

Catherine knew how the industry worked. She knew that FPP would never
have a genuine phase two---one that was used to enhance, rather than
fix, a product. And why was there no phase two? Because IT resource was
too scarce. There was a more complicated answer too: It was scarce
because we spent too much time building low value features. And why were
those low value features being built? Because the projects didn\'t have
a true, product-enhancing phase two, which made it safer for our
customers to limit the scope of what went into phase one. I believe that
is what they call a vicious circle.

Two more pros came to mind, neither of them needing much consideration:
Including extra features resulted in a bigger budget and a bigger piece
of the scarce IT pie, and low value features could be descoped, without
losing much, when the need arose. Add those two together and you build a
project with contingency---wiggle room---to absorb some overruns and
some change requests.

I spoke aloud to the dishes again, trying to organize my thoughts.
\"There is a natural priority within our customers\' requirements. They
only say everything is top priority because they feel compelled to
hoard.\" I nodded, liking what I heard.

\"There must be a way to get our customers to prioritize. If I can do
that, then I can break the vicious circle and break this conflict.\"

I nodded again. I liked where this was heading. But first, to be
complete, I needed to look for the cons of the conflict\'s other hand:
including only the highest value features---those that were indisputably
required.

That was easy. We sold our products based on the features in them. If we
only included the must-have features, we might find it hard to sell.
That would be bad. If our competitors\' products had more features, the
reasoning went, then their product was clearly better and people would
buy it rather than ours.

So, since we sell features and our customers buy features, the first con
of reducing features was that our products would be harder to sell.

I looked around the kitchen and decided that the con must be possible to
invalidate. The scrubbing brush I held in my hand did one thing and it
did it well. My refrigerator kept stuff cold, and I didn\'t want much
more from it than that (other than perhaps making a Star Trek
*whisssshhh* sound when the doors opened). Other things in the house had
plenty of extra features I never used. My microwave was a tiny little
thing we used to defrost and reheat, though when they first came out
they were sold as super-dooper oven replacements, with all sorts of
whiz-bang features. The remote control with its many unused buttons.
Same with the TV---I couldn\'t tell you what it said on the spec sheet
when I bought it, but I could tell you that we could watch TV shows on
it and that the mute button was worn out.

Why did we buy things based on the number of features, even if we rarely
use them? Was it because that\'s how businesses sold things? Was that
the only way?

I thought of Chaste again: They didn\'t sell feature-loaded products;
they sold simple products with just enough features that were easy to
understand and easy to use and easy to buy. Their products sold to
eighty percent of customers, even though they only had twenty percent of
the features.

And then that question again: How did we figure out exactly what the
highest value features were?
