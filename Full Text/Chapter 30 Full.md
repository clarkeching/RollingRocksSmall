Chapter 30
==========

Years earlier, when we were newly married, Fran and I had spent many of
our wintery Sunday afternoons taking long lunches with friends, visiting
museums and sitting in comfy coffee shop couches reading the papers. One
Sunday afternoon, the two of us visited a photography exhibition at
Watt\'s Bridge museum. The exhibition showed a timeline of aerial
photographs of Watt\'s Bridge. The earliest pictures were taken from
biplanes, I presume, way back at the start of the 20th century; more
recent pictures were taken by satellites. The exhibition had even
included several photographs taken in the early stages of World War II
by German flights in preparation for their planned invasion of Britain.

The dominant feature in the pictures was always the Castle. It\'d been
around since the 1500s, centuries before aircraft or cameras had been
invented and long before Watt\'s Bridge was even called Watt\'s Bridge.
The Castle walls had originally defined the city boundaries---they were
built as a defensive measure. Some structures were constant throughout
the pictures: the old Watt\'s Bridge rail bridge, the upper- and
middle-class Victorian housing.

But other features, like the new Watt\'s Road Bridge, acres and acres of
residential builds, schools, motorways and two new hospitals, had popped
up in the pictures bit by bit during the decades. Our local Tesco
supermarket sat in the exact same spot as a World War II ammunition
factory once had. Many of the poorer Victorian tenements were bulldozed
during the 1960s and 1970s, their residents unceremoniously moved to the
ghastly, modern high-risers, many of which have since been dynamited.

Things change.

That, I guess, is the nature of life.

If you looked carefully, you could clearly identify my house in many of
the photographs. Once upon a time it was the gatehouse of a great
estate, owned by Fran\'s ancestors. Their financial fortunes faded after
World War II, and although Fran\'s family technically still owns the
mansion and grounds, they are now a tourist attraction which all Watt\'s
Bridge could enjoy Tuesdays through Sundays and bank holiday Mondays.

To find our home, all you had to do was look for a big green patch in
the northwest corner of Watt\'s Bridge, identify the mansion house in
the middle of that, and then follow the tree-lined lane out past the
cemetery to the old coast road. And that\'s where we lived, in our old
stone house almost hidden among the ancient trees that bordered the
estate, just a few hundred yards from the sea and Fran\'s grave. If they
ever re-run that exhibition, you\'d see a trampoline and swing set in
our back yard, where my kids and their friends played whenever they
could, and Mom\'s granny flat (though we weren\'t ever allowed to call
it that).

Things change.

That is the nature of life.

These were the things I thought about while I drove home following my
conversation with Craig. I\'d tried snapping more pieces of the jigsaw
puzzle together, but I was too tired. And sometimes it was just nice to
think of Fran and the life we had back then, the life we planned.

I parked my car and climbed out, then paused to admire the Mansion
building in the distance---a habit I had developed over the years. The
building was normally closed at that time of day, but there was a lot of
activity on its costal side, where I saw a group of people assembling
marquees. I also spotted, through the trees bordering our property, a
dozen or so Scouts marching across the estate grounds. I slammed the car
door shut and went inside, hungry, tired, and bewildered---but
surprisingly enthusiastic about life. What a day I\'d had.

I found Mom in the kitchen tossing a salad for our dinner. She\'d
already put the kids to bed but said Ashley, my seven-year-old
sweetheart, was likely to still be reading if I wanted to kiss her good
night. I went upstairs to do just that, and before I knew it the kiss
had been negotiated into a kiss, a cuddle, and a chapter from one of her
sickly pink fairy books. I gave her a final kiss, tucked her in, turned
her lights out and closed the door. Then I popped into my bedroom where
I changed into something more comfortable. As I walked out onto the
landing, Alison, three years younger than Ashley but still awake,
shouted out, \"Night-night, Daddy.\"

I went in to say *night-night* and give her a cuddle. She told me a
joke: *Where does chocolate mousse come from?* (She pronounced it
moooooos). I gave up. *Chocolate Cows!*

I laughed disproportionally, said *night-night* again*,* then headed
down to the kitchen where Mom was grating Parmesan cheese.

I had thought we were having Parmesan chicken, but it turned out that
Mom had changed her mind and instead decided to cook one of my other
favorites, mushroom risotto. Such is the nature of evening meals. Mom
cooked the risotto the non-traditional, no-fuss way: in a non-stick wok,
which took a whole lot less stirring, and as far as I could tell, tasted
just as good. I poured us each a glass of New Zealand Pinot Gris while
Mom served up the food. As we ate I told her about my day. She sat
patiently listening to me, nodding appropriately and asking the right
questions in the right places.

Once I\'d finished, she asked me, \"How much faith do you have in this
Craig fellow?\"

\"Ummmm ... he comes highly recommended by Norbert.\"

\"I don\'t want you getting your hopes up.\"

\"Yeah, I know.\"

\"You know, Steven,\" she said, reaching across and resting her hand on
mine, \"things might not work out. You don\'t need the money, but you do
need to work. You\'ve always needed to work. It\'s who you are. I want
you to follow Norbert\'s direction and consider your other options,
while the timing is right. If you need to commute to Edinburgh or
Glasgow, then, well, we\'ll make that work somehow.\"

I snorted and waved the problem away with my hand. I wasn\'t ready to
give up on FPP yet.

\"I\'ll be okay.\"

Mom shook her head and made her serious face. \"You need to protect
yourself and your family. You need to start looking at other options.\"

I laughed, trying to hide my discomfort with this turn in conversation.
\"I could stay at home and look after Alison until she goes to school
next year.\" I looked at her to see her reaction. \"That would free up
your time a bit, too.\"

Her face hardened. \"Would you really do that? Really? I know you love
your kids enormously, but is that really something you want to do?\"

I looked down at the table and shook my head, chastened. We both knew
that would never work. I\'d go stir-crazy with no work to keep me busy.

\"In that case,\" she continued, \"you better do your best to make your
FPP project succeed. And, tomorrow, no matter what, you call your friend
Graeme.\" I made a face. Graeme worked for a high-end recruitment
company in Glasgow. We went to university together. \"Call him tomorrow.
Wyxcomb will never be as loyal to you as you are to it.\"

\"I, my ...\" I stammered. \"My loyalty isn\'t just to Wyxcomb. It\'s to
the people I work with, my entire team. If FPP fails then Wyx-Fin won\'t
be a happy place.

\"Oh, my poor darling.\" She shook her head with that disappointed look
only a mom can do, then spoke to me harshly. \"It\'s Miss World\'s and
Superman\'s jobs to save the world, not yours. I had hoped you\'d grown
out of that by now. You need to look out for yourself, and your
family.\"

With that she got up from the table and went to her apartment---her
granny flat--- at the back of the house. I started the cleanup.
