Chapter 54
==========

Saturday, October 21st

\"Norbert, you are *not* listening to me. We have no choice. We *have*
to call the vendor\'s specialists in from Australia. We cannot fix this
ourselves.\"

Phil was speaking---shouting, really---into the video conference camera
back in Watt\'s Bridge.

It was 10 a.m. there and 11 a.m. in Malmö, where I\'d called in from my
hotel room using my laptop\'s video conferencing software. Norbert was
at home across the bridge in Copenhagen. He\'d turned sixty earlier in
the week, and I was one of many who\'d flown over for the formal Wyxcomb
celebrations. He looked a lot healthier than I felt.

On the screen I could see Phil, Gregor and eight of our techies, who
looked smelly and tired. Five of them were Watt\'s Bridge locals and
three had been flown in from other European Wyxcomb sites to help us.
They were all back in Scotland in the FPP conference room, once again
our War Room.

Our infamous messaging system, which had caused us so much trouble when
we first inverted FPP, had delayed our first chunk and scared the
bejesus out of us. It had been working without hassle on our development
environments for weeks, but would not work on our production systems.

FPP wasn\'t GETS, yet. Our shipment had hit the fan, so to speak.
Everything we\'d worked on, all the promises we\'d made, were in
jeopardy.

Why? How? No one knew. Yet.

I added my news. \"I\'ve checked, and their specialists can catch a
flight from Melbourne today. They\'ll be tired when they get here but
they can start working on the problem tomorrow. Provided they stay off
the free booze.

Phil said, \"They can stick to the Australian time zone and we\'ll
switch to working nights if we have to.\"

Norbert said, \"Okay. Steve, fly them first class.\"

\"I\'m sure we can get business class flights.\"

\"No. We need them as productive as possible when they get to you. And
Steve, you need to initiate Plan B today.\"

I pulled a face. In Plan B we reverted to the old tried-and-tested
technology that the messaging system was supposed to replace. CORETRAN
used the old technology, and our CORETRAN developers were the only
experts in it. Most of those who knew the technology had retired by now,
and no younger folk with the brainpower to work on it would learn it
because, frankly, that was career suicide. If we went live with the old
technology, then all future FPP development would compete with every
other CORETRAN request. Our technology strategy was to do the exact
opposite, which was why FPP had used the new technology. Plan B sucked.

That said, Ron had figured out that his six best CORETRAN developers
could work with FPP\'s developers and testers to rip the guts of our new
messaging system code out of FPP and replace it, and still go live
within three to six weeks. That sounded too optimistic to me. So, we
might still launch on December 1st, if we started soon, but Ron had made
it very clear that we might hit a few quality issues after we went live,
given the breadth of the changes. I really didn\'t like Plan B.

I said, \"I think we should give the vendors another week.\"

I saw Norbert flinch on the screen in front of me. \"I did not ask you
to consider kicking off Plan B, Steven. It was not a question, it was an
instruction. Kick off Plan B, today, without delay.\" My team on the
video feed coming from Watt\'s Bridge all politely turned away from the
screen. Norbert said, \"Your only priority is to ship FPP on December
1st. Nothing else matters. Nothing. Do you understand that, Steven?\"

\"Yes.\" I blinked. \"I\'ll kick off plan B ASAP.\"

He shook his head. \"Not ASAP. Immediately.\"

I nodded. \"Okay.\"

He nodded and then hung up.

I thanked the guys in the War Room, suggested they go home and say hello
and goodbye to their loved ones, and that we\'d talk again at 4 p.m. I
asked Phil to hang on a minute.

He waited until the room was clear, then said, \"You okay?\"

I smiled weakly. \"Yeah.\"

\"Norbert\'s normally Mr. Nice Guy.\"

\"Yeah. Normally.\"

Phil and I chatted a few minutes, agreeing he\'d talk to Ron and
together they\'d kick off Plan B---immediately---and I\'d get the
flights from Australia sorted out.

We hung up, and I reached over and picked up my hotel phone. I dialed
the vendor\'s President\'s number from memory. I didn\'t know what time
it was there. I didn\'t care.
