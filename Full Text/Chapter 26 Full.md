Chapter 26
==========

I looked down at the deep, oil-filled fryer vats. There were three of
them. We had a small domestic version at home that Mom sometimes used
when cooking the kids\' dinner.

\"So this is where the magic happened?\" I said.

\"Indeed it did,\" said Cheryl. \"Now, tell me. What would happen if we
ever ran out of chips?\"

\"You\'d all be strung up outside the castle gates.\"

She nodded. \"Would that happen if we ran out of salad, or soup, or
two-week-old cabbage?\"

\"Not much. Maybe people would eat chips instead.\"

She nodded. \"Unspoken rule Number One around here is: Don\'t run out of
chips. Rule Two is Don\'t serve cold chips. Understand?\"

I smiled. \"Some things are sacred.\"

\"Our French Fry Revelation happened when Craig asked me why we never
ran out of chips and yet, at the same time, we rarely threw out chips
because of cooking too many. You know what I said to him?\"

\"No idea.\"

\"It\'s obvious, Steve. Our serving staff keeps an eye on how many chips
they\'ve got out front, and when it gets too low, they shout out and we
cook more. Craig says we *replenish on demand*. Has he asked you to not
think about small batches yet?\"

I looked at Craig, but he was eagerly reading a safety instruction
notice stuck beside the fryers. \"He has.\"

\"He did the same to me. It was like I was an oyster and he\'d planted a
bit of grit inside my shell, hoping I\'d turn it into a pearl. I spent a
few days trying hard to not think about small batches, but of course the
opposite happened. I soon figured out how to cook our vegetables in
small batches. It didn\'t take long to sell the idea to my team, and we
never looked back. It was scary at first. The first day was nuts, the
second day was a little bit less nuts, and things just kept getting less
nuts every day.\"

I said, \"Is that why you have a sign out front that says that some food
may contain nuts?\"

She ignored me. \"Nowadays, we prep most of the vegetables---clean them,
peel them, wash them, slice them, dice them---before the lunch rush. We
cook our first small batch just before lunch, and during the lunch
service our servers keep an eye out on what\'s selling. They shout out
to the cooks when we need to put on the next batch. With me?\"

I frowned. \"What happens if you\'re really busy? Maybe it\'s snowing
and no one wants to leave? Don\'t you run the risk of the kitchen not
keeping up? And all of those small batches must add overhead.\"

\"That could happen, but it doesn\'t. Can you figure out why?\"

I put my hand up to my chin and thought. \"Do you cook in larger
batches, based on demand?\"

\"Bingo!\" she said. \"Give the man a cigar!\"

Strange. That was the second time someone had offered me a cigar that
day.

\"Our customers loved our fresher tasting vegetables---loved it!---so we
figured out how to cook more food in smaller batches. You, being a
computer whiz, might not realize that not all foods---soup, for
instance---suffer from being cooked in big batches. Nonetheless, once we
were happy with our approach to vegetables, we picked soup as the second
food type to cook in smaller batches.\"

\"I don\'t understand.\"

Cheryl smiled. She\'d told her story so many times before, she\'d
figured out how to tell it like a mystery story. \"What if you cooked up
a big batch of soup at the start of the day but no one liked it?\"

Oh, okay. I could see where she was going now. \"People would buy it and
then moan about it to their friends. You\'d end up pouring the soup down
the sink.\"

\"And?\"

Hmm. \"And ... if it happened a lot then people just wouldn\'t risk
buying soup.\"

\"Exactly. So we cooked a smaller batch of soup, and if it wasn\'t
popular, we\'d put on a new flavor ASAP. And if the soup was popular,
then we\'d cook a bigger batch of the same, pronto.\"

\"So you must only sell soup that is quick to prepare?\" I asked.

\"Usually, though we do have some favorites that are safer.\"

I thought for a moment. \"So, cooking small batches not only improved
your product quality, it also solved your forecasting problem. Rather
than cooking in big batches, way in advance, you cook smaller batches,
which lets you adapt your menu according to what people are buying.\"

\"Exactly!\" said Cheryl. \"By the end of the first month, we were
serving thirty percent more customers, our revenue was up by forty
percent, and since most of our costs were fixed, we were suddenly
turning a healthy profit. We got to keep our jobs.\" She reached across
to Craig and patted him on the arm affectionately. \"And that not only
made us happy, but proud.\"

I nodded. \"There\'s one thing I don\'t understand. Surely switching to
smaller batches meant your kitchen staff was much busier over
lunchtime?\"

\"That\'s why we didn\'t change everything at once. And we did some
clever but simple things, like changing our menu to sell food that
cooked quickly and buying a few inexpensive pot dividers so we could
cook one big pot of three different vegetables all at the same time. We
also conducted a little clandestine commercial espionage.\"

Cheryl continued, smiling as she described how she and her staff took
turns visiting the good High Street lunch shops and spied on them to
learn how they worked. They used some of their early profits to purchase
two small ovens like the ones Subway uses, and they started baking small
batches of fresh lunch rolls throughout the lunch break. They replaced
two bain-maries with a sandwich bar, since they no longer needed the
storage space.

Her face beamed with obvious pride. \"Not bad, eh?\"

Craig said, \"Not bad at all.\"

And that, it seemed, was Cheryl\'s story. Remove defects at the front
end, build quality in, and produce small batches. All three had improved
the quality of the product. Small batches also helped them cook the food
customers wanted to buy rather than cooking stuff that got trashed.

It all made perfect sense.

To them.

But me? I had no idea how it applied to my situation. I didn\'t know
what small batches meant in a software context. And I suspected neither
did Craig. He may hope the principles Cheryl\'s team used also applied
to software development, but I was certainly a guinea pig. But for the
next few hours, I decided I would cross my fingers and hope he was
right. I had nothing left to lose.

Craig thanked Cheryl and we made our way back to our seats out front.

We both took a minute or two to check our phones. I had a dozen low
priority emails and a voice mail from Eleanor which more or less told me
that she was in Malmö with Hal, that she\'d spoken to Norbert, and that
I was to work with Craig or pack my bags. Nice.

I powered the phone down lest she call me again, then looked up and saw
Craig was waiting for me.

\"There\'s another thing Cheryl\'s team did that she forgot to tell you.
They thinned their menu of all but their most popular dishes. That give
them wiggle room during their peak times to learn how to work their new
way, and they gradually added new dishes, over time, to keep their menu
interesting.\"

\"Okay.\" It would be some time before I realized how important that
step---thinning the menu---would be to us.
