Chapter 47
==========

An hour later I stood, for the second time that day, atop Kelvin\'s
peak. I was puffing from the climb. I\'d taken the slow, hard route to
get there, climbing the paths worn over the years into the cliff face
rather than the asphalt path. My brain was buzzing.

We would deliver FPP on December 1st! It would be bare, bare bones, in
need of a good feed and a long relaxing bath and a pep talk to boost its
self-esteem, but it would be healthy, not riddled with bugs, and we
would start filling in the biggest gaps as soon as we launched. Most
importantly, Hal and Eleanor would keep their promise, and we\'d avoided
the unpleasant, though unnamed, consequences of failing to keep that
promise.

I\'d called Phil, Gregor and Tim into my office where I let Catherine
and Vrinda enjoy the pleasure of sharing our good news. Being sensible
folk, we\'d agreed to take a few hours out, let things consolidate in
our minds, then regroup at 4 p.m. with clearer heads. Provided we still
felt good after that meeting, I\'d speak to Eleanor and Catherine would
speak to Mark.

It was the sensible thing to do, really. Really, it was.

Catherine had gone off to her office. Vrinda had gone off to speak with
Phil, Tim and Gregor. And I took a long hard climb up a steep hill.

I looked around me. The bench where Phil and I sat earlier that morning
was occupied by a Mom and her two kids, one just a baby sitting in a
stroller, the other a toddler sitting on the bench beside his mom,
swinging his little legs in front of him. I sat on a seat-shaped rock
near the cliff edge. School kids wearing brightly colored sports
uniforms played hockey in the fields below.

I\'d bought a cheese baguette on the way there. I bit off a chunk and
washed it down with some water.

I turned my face towards the sun, closed my eyes and thought of
precisely nothing.

I heard shouts from the hockey game below me, and the occasional seagull
squawked from above.

I let the pleasant calmness linger for as long as I could until I broke
my promise to Catherine and Vrinda. I pulled out my phone and dialed
Eleanor.

As I waited for her to answer, I picked a pebble from the ground beside
my rock and gently flicked it over the edge of the cliff face. I leaned
forward and watched it effortlessly bounce its way down, down, down into
the brush at the bottom.

Interesting. Gravity didn\'t always suck.
