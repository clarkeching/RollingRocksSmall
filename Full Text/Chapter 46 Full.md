Chapter 46
==========

I returned to my office and found Vrinda sitting next to Catherine. They
appeared deep in conversation around my laptop. I fake-coughed and they
looked up.

Vrinda smiled. \"At last! Our white knight has returned! Pull up a pew.
We have a disaster.\"

I pulled my chair over. \"Disaster?\"

\"We have brutally sliced and diced the spreadsheet until the bare bones
product not only has no meat on it, it\'s missing a few important
bones.\"

\"Ouch \...\" I wasn\'t sure if she thought that was a good thing or a
bad thing.

\"Don\'t worry, it\'s still good enough to go live---barely. Provided we
keep adding bones, then muscle and so forth after. Problem is, we can\'t
prune much more and we don\'t know if it\'s enough. We\'re not brave
enough to run your macro.\"

Catherine said, \"You said not to. And Gregor is in a meeting.\"

Now that was the sort of disaster I knew I could handle. I said I would
show them, but I asked to hear more about their updates, first. There
was no rush, I said.

That wasn\'t true. I desperately wanted to reach across the table and
grab the laptop, bumping up our execution speed by fifty percent. But I
held back lest I blunt Catherine\'s enthusiasm for slicing and dicing.

\"I\'ll start with the bad news,\" Catherine said, \"which is that we
got lucky when I picked the Search feature and none of the other
features can be thinned out nearly as much. The good news is, we did
discard roughly a fifth of the scenarios across the other features.\"

\"That *is* good.\"

\"There\'s more, but first let me ask you something.\"

\"Okay.\"

\"How would you feel, Steve, if we launched without the statement
feature in place, but delivered it by early January? Our first statement
run is mid-January.\"

I checked Catherine\'s laptop to see how much work was involved. Roughly
one to two weeks, assuming it wasn\'t full of bugs. \"It\'s doable, but
with the holiday break at the end of December, it\'d need to be the
first thing we started working on after launch.\"

Vrinda said, \"The thirty-day penalty-free cancelation period is
similar, and there are a few other Day Two scenarios like that.\"

Catherine nodded. \"We have four Day Two scenarios and a bunch of others
which must be live before sales warm up in March. And we\'ve clearly
identified a lot of features and scenarios that must be live on December
1st, as well as a whole other bunch which we might need, but we might
not.\"

\"Got an example?\"

\"A lot of them are processes which we\'d prefer were all automated, but
we might survive if some weren\'t.\"

\"Like?\"

She waved her hand in front of me, as if it were obvious. \"We could use
the existing cumbersome refunds process, if we don\'t have to do many
refunds. But if we do get a lot of refunds, then we\'d need to automate
the process or recruit more CSRs just to do that process. Trouble is,
right now we\'ve got no way of knowing how many refunds we\'ll get.\"

\"Okay.\"

Catherine said, \"I\'m calling this bunch \'demand-based,\' and I\'m
guessing we\'ll need a third of them. Though since I don\'t know which
third, I\'m very happy to launch without them, provided you set aside a
fixed percentage of your team\'s capacity to build them based on
demand.\"

I bit down on my lip, then smiled to myself. \"You mean, you want to
wing it?\"

Catherine furrowed her brow. \"That\'s not how I\'d describe it, but
yes, I suppose so. We\'ll \'wing it,\' but in a disciplined and planned
way. Assuming Eleanor approves more budget in April, then I\'d like to
run that way until the money runs out.\"

I said good, and it *was* good. Not just for FPP, but for me, too. For
the first time in my career, one of my customers had requested we work
to a fixed budget, variable scope promise. Who\'d have thought?

Also, from what I\'d heard I suspected Catherine and Vrinda had
prioritized FPP\'s scope enough that, combined with our bottleneck
improvements, we might just make it.

Feeling rather pleased, I decided it was time to put them---and me---out
of our misery.

I reached across the table to the laptop and kicked off the
recalculation macro that Gregor had built. I clicked the summary tab,
frowned when I saw the results.

The earliest date we could ship the bare bones scenarios occurred in the
second week of November, but the most likely delivery date was
mid-December.

I hadn\'t adjusted our speed yet, however.

We\'d made it.

But I didn\'t smile, even though that was the exact moment I stopped
worrying about FPP. I chose not to put Catherine and Vrinda out of their
misery because I knew that if I did, Catherine would stop her slicing
and dicing. I didn\'t know what clever ideas hadn\'t been found yet for
lack of hunting, but I knew that they were there. I didn\'t want to
remove the pressure, the desperation.

I turned the laptop screen to face them and waited for their reaction.

\"Wow.\" Vrinda shook her head in amazement. \"We\'ve now got good odds
of delivering by December 1st. That\'s brilliant!\"

Catherine\'s reaction was different. She dropped her head down until her
chin rested on her chest. She closed her eyes. Her hair fell down over
her face and I heard her mumbled words. \"This isn\'t good enough.
December 1st needs to be a definite---a slam dunk.\"

Vrinda broke the silence about a minute later. \"There must be more we
can do.\"

Catherine lifted her head and brushed her hair away. \"Perhaps, but I
don\'t know where else to look.\"

None of us spoke.

Catherine said, \"I need to make a call.\" She grabbed her phone from
her handbag and left the office.

Vrinda and I poked around inside the spreadsheet while she was gone, but
didn\'t come up with any new ideas.

\"Right!\" Catherine said as she rejoined us at the table. \"Are either
of you familiar with the concept of customer segmentation?\"

We both nodded. Vrinda said, \"It\'s where marketing divides their
customers up into different groups, like DINKIES---Double Income No
Kids, and YUPPIES---Young Urban Professionals. Each segment has
different needs, so clever businesses treat them differently.\"

Catherine nodded. \"Mark suggests we segment the product to allow us to
launch FPP to fewer customer segments, provided we add others later.
With me?\"

We both nodded.

Catherine said, \"One brute-force and unimaginative segmentation might
be new customers; another would be existing customers.\"

Vrinda said, \"We could save a lot of pre-December work if we only take
on existing Wyx-group customers. Credit checking, for instance. We
haven\'t even started testing that yet.\"

\"Alternatively, we could delay our migration work if we only took on
new customers,\" Catherine said.

\"Other segments are people who aren\'t retiring in the next five years,
people who are retiring soon, and people who\'ve already retired. Each
segment has quite different processes.\"

I smiled and said, \"You know, if we didn\'t sell the product in Wales,
we could avoid the Welsh language customizations. It\'s a small thing
from a development perspective, but it\'d simplify testing.\"

\"You want to start a civil war with the Welsh?\" said Catherine, before
rattling off another three ways we could potentially slice and dice our
customers. So to speak.

We spent a few minutes debating our options before Catherine said she
simply had to call Mark in since these types of decisions were way above
her pay grade.

I waved away the suggestion. \"Let\'s do that tomorrow.\"

Catherine\'s head jerked up. \"No. Today. We\'ve not got time to
waste.\"

I shook my head. \"No.\" I tried to suppress my smile, but failed.
\"We\'ve no need to rush.\"

Her eyes narrowed. \"Why?\"

\"Watch.\" I turned her laptop to face me, but when I tapped the key it
asked for Catherine\'s password, which dulled the spectacle somewhat.
But within thirty seconds, I\'d clicked the spreadsheet tab holding
Gregor\'s and my assumptions and bumped our assumed speed up by half for
each of the best, most likely, and worst case scenarios.

As Catherine watched, she said, \"You arse. You lied to us.\"

I switched back to the summary tab and hovered the mouse over the macro
button. I looked at them both. \"Are you guys ready?\"

They nodded. All three of us leaned in closer to the screen.

I clicked the macro, and with just the merest pause, the numbers
changed. We had our slam dunk.

Catherine\'s jaw fell open and she leaned in closer to the screen,
blinking as if she could not believe her eyes. \"No way! No way! No
way!\"

Vrinda looked at the screen, then to me, then back to the screen, then
back to me. \"We\'ve made it? We\'ve really made it?\"

I nodded. \"We\'ve made it.\"
