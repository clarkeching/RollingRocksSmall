Chapter 40
==========

Monday, September 25th

\"You\'re not one of them vegetarians, are you?\"

The clock on Cheryl\'s office wall said it was 6:17 a.m.

\"Nope.\"

She said in that case, she\'d be delighted to tell me about the book
and---even better---her bottlenecks. But first, she insisted on cooking
me up a bacon and egg breakfast.

\"Bacon and eggs?\"

\"That\'s what I said.\"

\"Love some.\"

I yawned my thanks, and a few minutes later she returned with a large
plate and an extra-large mug filled with thick black coffee. Lavazza,
she said, Pavarotti\'s favorite. She plucked a mandarin from the fruit
bowl on her desk and peeled it while I tucked into my breakfast.

\"So this book, *The Goal*. It\'s a novel, a business novel. It\'s about
this factory manager, called Alex, who rescues his factory from closure
by cutting his batch sizes and managing his bottleneck, among other
things.\"

I munched away on my breakfast while she talked.

\"First, you know what a real bottleneck is, right? It\'s the neck of
the bottle. The skinniest part at the top. What would happen if you went
out into the dining area, grabbed one of those big water cooler bottles
out there and upended it?

\"Water would rush out.\"

\"How long would it take to empty the bottle? Guess.\"

I imagined lifting the bottle, hefting it upside down and watching the
water pour out: *glug, glug, glug*. \"A minute?\"

\"And what if the bottle\'s neck were skinnier?\"

\"It would take longer.\"

\"And if it were wider?

\"It would flow faster.\"

She nodded. \"That\'s the thing with bottlenecks. They\'re only a tiny
part of the bottle, but they determine how fast stuff flows. With me?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"More coffee?\"

\"Not yet.\"

\"Before I tell you about our bottleneck, let me tell you about the
person who taught me about bottlenecks.

\"Soon after Craig visited, we got so busy with new customers we
couldn\'t keep up. You could say our success was a disaster. I called
Craig, and he asked me where my bottleneck was. I said I didn\'t know,
and he sent me to meet Mahjella, who works in the accounts department of
the Wyx-Fin Bank.\"

Sounded familiar. \"Did she cook you breakfast?\"

Cheryl ignored my question. \"Mahjella ran Wyx-Bank\'s accounts payable
team. They pay the bank\'s suppliers\' invoices. Apparently, everything
was going dandy until they got a new computer system that had a few
problems and left them with a big backlog of unpaid invoices. Basically,
they couldn\'t keep up with their work.

\"Mahjella told me how they processed each invoice following five steps.
First, someone opened the mail and checked the invoice. Second, someone
matched the invoice up with a purchase order. Third, they keyed the
details into the computer. Fourth, they assigned an accounting code and
approved the payment. And, fifth, they pushed a button on the computer
which submitted a whole batch of invoices to be paid.\"

She put the mandarin down and held up her left hand, fingers fanned out.

\"Now, a question for you.\" She pointed to the thumb on her left hand.
\"Let\'s say this thumb represents step one, and they could open a
hundred invoices each hour.\" She moved to the index finger, then across
the other fingers one at a time. \"They can do eighty invoices an hour
in step two, one-twenty in step three, fifty in the fourth step, and the
little pinkie, a computerized batch process, processed thousands in a
matter of minutes. Given those numbers, what\'s the most they can
process in an hour, Steve?\"

I pointed to her fourth finger. \"Fifty.\"

She nodded. \"That\'s the bottleneck. If you needed to process more
invoices, where would you focus your efforts?\"

\"That fourth step. Figure out how to do sixty units per hour and the
entire team\'s output would jump up by twenty percent.\"

She smiled slyly. \"If they made any other step faster, would the
department process any more invoices?\"

\"No.\"

\"Exactly!\" She slapped her hand on the table for effect. \"Mahjella
had twelve people in her team, but she was the only person authorized to
do the bottleneck process. The others worked on steps one through
three.\"

I thought a moment, then said, \"Was she the bottleneck? The point to
improve?\"

Cheryl picked up the mandarin again and nodded. \"And guess what? She
didn\'t spend all of her time doing step four, because she spent much of
her day on the phone apologizing to suppliers who wanted their invoices
paid.\"

\"She was a busy lady.\"

\"Aren\'t we all ...\" Cheryl shook her head. \"But anyway. Once
Mahjella realized she was the bottleneck, it took her less than an hour
to figure out how to sort things out. Can you guess what she did?\"

I finished off the last bite of my bacon and eggs, then took a slurp of
coffee.

\"She had to stop talking to suppliers, so I bet she locked herself away
in a room somewhere and just focused on step four.\"

\"Bingo! She did some other things too. Her senior staff started
checking every invoice before it reached her, so she didn\'t waste her
precious bottleneck time working on bad data. Her team started opening
the mail first thing each morning so Mahjella was never starved of work.
Within a week, she said, they\'d cleared their backlog, the unhappy
phone calls went away, and everything was all hunky-dory.\"

Cheryl finished her mandarin and picked up another, peeling it and
passing me a couple of segments. \"We all know the secret to life is
focus. But that only works if you know where to focus: your
bottleneck.\"

I bit down and the mandarin\'s sweet juices flooded inside my mouth.

\"Where was your bottleneck, Cheryl?\"

\"We didn\'t have one.\"

\"Oh.\" I wasn\'t sure how to respond. Then I saw her lips curled into a
smile. She was teasing me. \"Before Craig helped us, we didn\'t have a
bottleneck because we had far more capacity than we did customers. It
was only after we fixed our quality problems and more staff started
coming downstairs for lunch, rather than going to High Street, that all
my spare capacity got used up. One week we were fine, the next we were
unusually busy, the next we had long queues out in the serving area and
folk started to complain. From good to bad, like fresh fish on a hot
day.

\"I spoke to Mahjella, then I read *The Goal* and went looking for my
bottleneck. When I found it, it was obvious---in hindsight.\"

\"So where was it?\"

\"China.\"

\"Where?\"

\"Not where. *What*. Follow me.\"

She picked up my plate, empty if you ignored the streaks of egg yolk,
and led me out through the kitchen to the swinging doors. She opened
them and then turned back to face the kitchen. I did the same.

\"I spent hours wandering around inside the kitchen, trying to spot
clues that would point to my bottleneck, but nothing jumped out at me.
No piles of unfinished work, like in the book, no abnormal screaming or
shouting.\"

She led me into the serving area. \"But when I watched our customers
lining up and waiting to be served, the bottleneck jumped out at me. See
down there. The china.\"

She pointed at two tall stacks of plates sitting behind the serving
area. \"We didn\'t have enough clean plates during peak hours to serve
all our new customers.\"

\"Did you call this your \"China Syndrome\" by chance?\"

\"Nope,\" she said, smiling patiently. \"Now, imagine it\'s 12:30, peak
time, and suddenly the customers stop moving and the queue starts to
build up. And why\'s that? There\'s plenty of food, plenty of serving
staff, but no plates. I ask the servers, *Where\'re all the damned
plates?* and they say they\'ve run out. I ask what they\'ve done about
it, and they say they\'ve told the dishwashers and they\'re expecting a
fresh batch through in a few minutes. And true enough, within minutes
clean plates arrive and we start serving again. But not before a queue
has built up and we\'d lost a few impatient customers to High Street.\"

I smiled, knowing what came next. \"So you bought more plates?\"

She shook her head, her jaw set firmly. \"Nope. I couldn\'t ask for more
money, so I did what it said to do in the book. Before spending lots of
money, try to make your bottleneck more efficient.\" She shrugged. \"It
turned out, we had plenty of plates; the trouble was that most of them
were ...\"

I realized I was meant to finish her sentence. \"Dirty?\"

She nodded. \"Follow me.\" She led me through the kitchen to the
dishwashing area and placed my breakfast plate on a rack that sat on a
small conveyor belt in front of a silver machine. \"This is our
dishwasher.\"

I nodded, though it didn\'t look like any dishwasher I\'d seen before.

\"Watch this.\" She pushed a button and the conveyor started moving,
carrying my dirty plate through the machine.

\"It takes eight seconds for a dirty plate to travel through the washer,
and the water is so hot, it\'s evaporated and the plates are dry when
they come out the other side.\" She picked up my plate and added it to a
stack of clean plates.

\"Our bottleneck was caused because our dishwashers worked in big
batches. We had plenty of plates, but too many were sitting waiting to
be cleaned or waiting to be moved back to their serving area. We
switched to smaller batches, kept the plates circulating, and the
bottleneck went away.\"

We went back to her office. \"The thing about bottlenecks is that once
you get rid of one, another eventually takes its place. It\'s like
playing Whack-A-Mole. Our next bottleneck was at the tills. We had
enough money by then, so we purchased another till and employed a
part-time cashier.

\"These days I have spare capacity, so I don\'t have a bottleneck. As we
keep growing, our next bottleneck will be the number of seats in our
dining area. I\'m trying to avoid that by adding more takeout options
and I\'m considering a delivery service.\"

I thanked Cheryl for her time, her food for thought and her food for
real.

She offered me one parting thought. \"We used to be a disliked cost
center, you know. Nowadays we are a much-liked profit center. It\'s a
much happier place to work, what with the happy customers and happy
bosses.\"

It was still early, and it was a beautiful morning. It felt wrong to
waste it sitting at a desk. I called Phil, figuring he\'d be running or
cycling into work.

He answered quickly. \"What\'s up, dude?\"

I asked him to meet me atop Lord Kelvin\'s Peak, ASAP.
