Chapter 36
==========

Friday, September 22nd

\"The Queen thinks the world smells of wet paint, Steven.\"

Erm. I glanced down at Eleanor, trying to figure out what she meant.

She\'d just stepped out of the lift and I had expected her to castigate
me, maybe even castrate me, but instead she chose to complicate things
by sharing bewildering facts about the British royal family.

\"According to my husband, she does.\" Perhaps it was an accountant
joke?

She smiled to herself, gestured around the sixth floor, and whispered,
\"Look at how magnificently busy everyone is.\"

I\'d passed the word around that everyone better be well-dressed and on
their best behavior for Eleanor\'s visit, given what happened last time
she visited our floor. We\'d not painted anything, but we had tidied the
place up a good bit. I knew Eleanor was going to beat me up later that
morning, so I was keen to make the best impression I could before then.

I smiled and decided to tell Eleanor my own royal family joke. I made it
up when I was twelve. \"And I heard that the Queen wears three
hundred-pound knickers. She must weigh a ton when she\'s fully
dressed.\"

I smiled.

Eleanor didn\'t.

\"I have no idea what you are talking about, Steven. Now, where is this
demonstration taking place?\"

We were about to demonstrate our third chunk of potentially shippable
software to Eleanor. Ten days had passed since we had finally
demonstrated the first, four days since our second. Catherine had
invited Mark Richmond to the second demo, and Eleanor invited herself to
view the third.

I pointed across the room to the conference room. \"My team is looking
forward to seeing you again. We\'ve catered a buffet lunch, and we\'ll
demonstrate the software as we eat.\"

\"The *GETS* software?\" she asked, emphasizing the word GETS, which
she\'d decided was easier to say than \"Good Enough To Ship.\" It had
caught on throughout the company. I\'d met with her a half dozen times
during the previous weeks, bringing her up to speed with our new
approach, and she genuinely seemed to like it.

\"Absolutely.\"

\"And FPP is currently technically, but not commercially, GETS.
Correct?\"

\"Correct.\" Not enough of the overall system was good enough to ship
yet, though more and more bits were being tested and fixed every day, so
we were getting there.

\"Do you and your project manager have a date for when the system will
be commercially GETS?\"

\"Not yet.\"

She paused and crossed her arms, but kept her face neutral. \"Will
everyone fit in your tiny conference room, Steven?\"

\"They will. They\'re there already, waiting for us. All except for
Craig Lally.\" I checked my watch. \"He\'ll be joining us in a few
minutes. And then he\'s flying off to Norway, later in the day.\"

I was leaving work early too. The kids and I were flying to Euro Disney
for the weekend. I hadn\'t been around much in recent months and I owed
them something special. They didn\'t know about it, but I\'d been
dropping hints.

"Your *small* conference room?" She looked across at the room and then
her frown deepened. \"Oh, Steven. I wanted to meet your *entire* team,
not just your leadership team.\"

She scanned the floor, then charged off across the room. I followed
along behind, no idea where she was heading. She stopped abruptly in
front of a bank of desks where three of my staff sat: a skinny young
Polish guy called Krzysztof who worked as an analyst; Brian, a beefy
Northern Irish developer who had a reputation for being quietly
competent; and Sharon, one of our younger testers who started working in
our call centers fresh out of school before making her way into our IT
department. Shortly after inverting FPP, Tim and Gregor had re-organized
the teams into several smaller teams. Each team included at least one
person from each role, and they all sat together to work on a specific
feature. I didn\'t know what feature this small team worked on. I hoped
my ignorance wouldn\'t matter.

Eleanor eyed Krzysztof, Brian, and Sharon for a moment. She looked like
a hungry lioness picking out an antelope for dinner. Using her finely
tuned hunting instincts, she picked Krzysztof---clearly the skinniest
and weakest antelope.

She stuck out her hand and said cheerfully, \"Hello, I\'m Eleanor
Scharlau. I\'m the Chief Financial Officer. Tell me, who are you, young
man?\"

Krzysztof looked startled. I felt terrified. Kryz was an excellent
technician, but he wasn\'t big on political smarts. I hoped he wouldn\'t
embarrass himself. No, that\'s not quite true. I wasn\'t all that
bothered if he embarrassed himself; I just hoped he didn\'t embarrass
me.

\"This is Krzysztof,\" I said quietly, trying to hide my frustration
that Eleanor had so blatantly disrupted and taken control of my
well-planned morning.

She turned and glared. \"I\'m quite sure Krzysztof knows his own name,
Steven,\" then turned back to Kryz and smiled in a way that could be
described as charming---if you didn\'t know better.

She smiled widely at Kryz, like the politician she was, then reached out
and gently touched him on his lower arm. \"How are things going?\"

I scanned the room and identified the emergency exits.

Kryz asked, eyes darting to me, if she was referring to life in general
or FPP in particular.

Eleanor chuckled. \"Why don\'t you tell me about both?\"

Kryz said that generally, he was doing fine, thank you very much for
asking. He paused as he chose his next words carefully. \"Eleanor, the
first thing about FPP that is good is how it does not feel anymore like
we are flogging a dead horse.\" Eleanor told him that was nice. He
continued. \"The second thing is that I was not pleased at all when
Steve announced FPP was starting the testing phase early. I am an
analyst, not a tester, so I hate testing. You see?\"

Eleanor *tsked*, then leaned in towards him and said just loud enough
that only Kryz and I could hear, \"But isn\'t it common practice, Kryz,
for analysts to help out with the testing? I\'m sure Steve explained
that to me once.\"

\"It is. And, some analysts don\'t mind doing monkey work. But I do.\"

I cringed. Many of my analysts, and developers too, disliked doing
testing---especially long runs of it. Testing is a specific skill; it
requires a different temperament and a different (some say evil) way of
thinking. I understood that they didn\'t like it, but there wasn\'t
always enough analysis work during the testing phase to keep the
analysts busy. However, there was always more than enough testing for
them to do. They grumbled, but had more sense than to call it monkey
work in front of our CFO. Most of them, anyway.

At least, I thought, Kryz hadn\'t made actual monkey noises.

Eleanor pulled a sad face, then glared at me. \"Oh. That\'s a shame.\"

I shrugged. What did she expect? If she\'d only wanted to hear good news
then she should have stuck to my carefully choreographed good news tour.

Kryz said, \"But anyway, that doesn\'t matter so much now. FPP, like
we\'re doing it now, is different than other projects I\'ve worked on.
It is not perfect, but it is different. And better. Don\'t get me wrong,
the first chunk was horrible, very stressful and loads of testing and
waiting and more testing. *Boring.* The second chunk was a little less
stressful, less monkey work, less downtime. And this last chunk is even
a bit better. I do some testing each week and I also do some analysis. A
bit of testing, a bit of analysis. A bit more testing, a bit more
analysis. And you know what? The three of us have gotten pretty good at
doing the testing, analysis and rework together. This is the first time
since I\'ve been working here that analysts, developers and testers have
worked together as a team.\" He nodded emphatically. \"I like that very
much.\"

Eleanor started to speak, but Kryz had more to say.

\"What\'s best, though, is that when I look forward from here, I see
that every week or so we will actually finish something. We finish
something and then we give it to our customers and they tell us whether
they like it or not. That is good, actually.\"

Eleanor nodded and told Kryz that Catherine and her team were very
pleased with how things were going. They\'d be even happier, she added,
if they knew for sure we\'d deliver on December 1st.

\"Catherine is a very nice lady.\" Kryz smiled. \"She told us that
starting our new Inverted Pyramid way of working had been like
force-feeding our department a pile of prunes. We finally got things
flowing.\"

Eleanor smiled, then invited herself into the cubicle. I followed her
in, still not sure how this was all going to end.

Eleanor asked Kryz to show her what he was currently working on. We sat,
and Eleanor pointed at a silver framed photograph that sat amongst
several piles of paper, a collection a miniature themed chess sets and
two deadish-looking cacti. Eleanor asked if the picture was of his
girlfriend. He said it was his in fact his fiancée, and they discussed
his wedding plans for a very long five minutes. Kryz invited Eleanor to
attend his wedding, but unfortunately, it turned out that Eleanor was in
Barcelona the weekend of Kryz\'s wedding, otherwise she would have loved
to attend. She said.

At last, Eleanor asked Kryz what was on his screen. He said that he and
Sharon were both regression testing part of the system. Eleanor asked if
he thought the software was good enough to ship. He said that provided
their coming round of regression testing proved they hadn\'t broken
anything while fixing the newly found bugs, then it would be. So far
they\'d found no new problems.

He told her she could drive for a while and passed her the mouse. He
showed her where to click on the screen and then guided her smoothly
through the many screens of the new FPP application. I presume Kryz
deliberately guided her away from the parts of the system that weren\'t
yet GETS, because there were no disasters.

As they played around with the software, I looked across the floor
towards the conference room where FPP\'s leadership team waited. Phil
and Vrinda stood at the window watching us. Phil held his arm out in
front of him and tapped his watch, then rubbed his stomach in
exaggerated circular movements. I made a face back at them and decided
to let Eleanor continue on with her demo. This was the first time she\'d
ever seen, up close and personal, the software we were working on. In
some ways, this was better than the stage-managed demo waiting for her
in the conference room. It was scarier, but also more believable, more
concrete. And if we *were* genuinely shipping GETS software, Eleanor
shouldn\'t stumble across too many problems.

A few minutes into Kryz\'s tour, I felt a light tap on my arm. I turned
to see Craig Lally standing beside me with a friendly grin on his face.
His beard was a good inch longer than the last time I had seen him and
his face was tanned.

I shook his hand, whispered, \"Hi ya,\" then pointed at Eleanor and did
a thumbs-up gesture.

He mouthed, \"Good.\"

I decided to give Eleanor and Kryz just another minute. The sausage
rolls would have cooled by now, and the sandwiches would be warm. And we
were way behind schedule.

I whispered to Craig, \"Good trip?\"

\"Yep.\"

I cleared my throat to get their attention. Eleanor and the others
turned to face me. Eleanor acknowledged Craig with a smile and I said,
\"We really should wrap things up.\"

Eleanor agreed and put down the mouse, but before she could stand, Kryz
asked her if she wanted to see something *really* interesting.

\"Really interesting?\"

He nodded. \"We have figured out a very cheap, simple way to find bugs
in the software without actually testing it.\"

She glanced at me, then turned back to Kryz and said, \"Of course, Kryz.
I\'m always interested in really interesting things.\"
