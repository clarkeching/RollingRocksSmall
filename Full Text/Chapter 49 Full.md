Chapter 49
==========

A seagull squawked above me.

I tore a crust off my baguette and threw it high in the air towards the
bird. It caught it in midair then swooped away without even saying thank
you. I named it Hal the Seagull then sat back and waited for it to fly
over and poop on my head.

I waited a full minute before Eleanor spoke. \"This may change
everything. I need to tell you something, Steve. You cannot share it
with anyone. Promise me?\"

I adjusted myself so I was comfortable on my rock. \"I promise.\"

\"I did not believe you would deliver FPP on time. Nor did Hal. Nor
anyone in Group. So your good news, while it is good, has taken us by
surprise. Do you understand?\"

\"I understand.\" I didn\'t tell her I was probably more surprised than
they were.

\"FPP was Hal\'s get-out-of-jail-free card. With that card in question,
we were forced to take some drastic actions. FPP may yet save us from
having to follow through on them.\"

She paused.

\"Of course, it might not. It all depends on how well FPP sells when we
launch. This is very important, Steven, so listen carefully. Do you
understand the financial implications of delivering FPP in December?\"

I thought a moment before answering. I hadn\'t expected a quiz. FPP was
a little over its budget, but we always expected that, so I didn\'t
think that was what she was fishing for. On the other hand, previously
we\'d expected FPP to launch during the summer of next year, if we got
lucky, so if we wrapped up FPP in December, that\'d save us around eight
months.

I said, \"FPP development costs a quarter of a million each month. If we
finish FPP in December rather than, say, July, we\'ve reduced FPP\'s
development cost by roughly two million pounds. Is that what you\'re
looking for?\"

\"No. First, there\'s no way now that we will stop development work on
FPP in December. We may shrink the team, but I doubt it. FPP is
inadequate and we will continue investing in it, growing it into the
type of product we need. Second, while you are correct that if we did
stop FPP in December then FPP\'s costs would be lower, but apart from
losing a few contractors your department\'s overall cost won\'t drop,
because we will start other projects.

\"No, Steven, the only thing that matters going forward is how well FPP
sells. Now try again. What are the financial implications of delivering
early?\"

I paused, not knowing where to start.

I heard her sigh. \"Let\'s take this slowly. When Mark first proposed
this project, he presented several financial scenarios for the Future
Perfect product, each with different assumptions and different cash flow
figures. When I say cash flow I mean net cash, the difference between
the cash we spend operating the new Future Perfect business and the
revenue we receive from our new customers. Understand?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"Scenario one optimistically assumes Future Perfect will pull in four
million pounds a month in net cash after we launch in December. That
figure is not what we\'d earn from day one, obviously, but it\'s the
average projected over the following three years. The equivalent figure
for scenario two was two million. And for scenario three it was only one
million. Follow?\"

Once again I said yes.

\"So, where are we now? Our severely cut-down product looks disturbingly
like our aggressive and much loved competitor\'s, so there\'s no
discernible reason for new customers to prefer ours to theirs. But it\'s
an adequate product and we have a loyal customer base and an effective
retail network. So, I pragmatically and pessimistically assume it will
pull in a mere half million a month, on average, starting in December.
With me?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"Now, given that\'s money coming in we didn\'t have, tell me, what are
the financial implications of delivering early?\"

My mouth slowly fell open as I crunched the numbers. The math was easy.
Eight months unexpected selling, at half a million pounds each month,
was four million pounds. That was four million cash in our coffers that
wouldn\'t have been there otherwise.

I, with some help, had just made a significant contribution to the
Group\'s finances.

Wyx-Fin had given a measly three million pounds profit back to Group the
previous year, and barely broke even the year before. I knew cash flow
numbers didn\'t translate directly into profit and loss numbers, but
delivering FPP early had huge financial implications.

I smiled to myself, but then it occurred to me that Eleanor was treating
me like I was some kind of idiot when really I was a hero. I put my
tongue firmly into my cheek. \"Wow. Two and half million pounds?\"

She was silent for a few seconds. \"Are you serious?\"

\"No, of course not. And who\'d have thought that a drunken confession
from a former employee would cause us to bring us something like four
million cash into the company?\"

\"Who\'d have thought, indeed. Halifax thinks it was his inspirational
leadership.\"

\"Hal is happy with me then, right?\" He should have been. Adding four
million extra to his piggy bank was like giving his tarnished career a
good spit and polish.

She chuckled. \"Hal happy? What an interesting idea. No, he isn\'t
happy. Those drastic actions I can\'t tell you about are still in play.
Is he happy with you? As far as he is concerned, you promised to deliver
FPP on February 1st, and pulling the date forward two months was just
good management on his part. You\'re playing with the big boys and girls
now, Steve. Get over it.\"

And then she hung up on me.

The seagull had pooped on me, after all.
