Chapter 22
==========

I was in a fowl mood when I made it back to my desk. Yes, *fowl*, not
foul. While I was in the elevator, somewhere between the second and the
fourth floor, the rational part of my brain clicked in. I turned into a
big chicken and pushed the button for the sixth floor instead of the
penthouse. I\'d spent almost twenty years climbing the Wyxcomb ladder,
and I wasn\'t about to throw that all away impulsively.

Instead of giving Hal an excuse to dump me, I summoned Gregor to my
office and laid down the law: no compulsory overtime, no cancelled
vacations, and start thinking real hard about how to get this project
back on track.

His response was a question.

\"What would you have done differently?\"

\"Pardon?\"

\"If you were in my shoes. What would you have done differently?\"

I licked my lips, buying time, then took a deep breath and did the only
thing I could. I apologized. He was right. He had done exactly what I
would have done had I been in his shoes. And worse, I was doing exactly
what my predecessors would have done in my situation. I told him that.

He shrugged and said he was old enough, ugly enough and grumpy enough to
be thick-skinned enough to know that sometimes taking the blame was just
part of his job.

I shook my head. \"But it shouldn\'t be. We should be better at this.\"

We left it at that, and I sat down at my desk and tried to figure out
what to do next.

I knew I should call Eleanor, but I avoided that conversation and waded
through my emails instead. I gave up when I got to one from Hal\'s
personal assistant asking *me* to look at her printer because it was
jamming a lot. I shook my head, swore briefly under my breath, then
called our help desk manager and asked her to look into it for me.

I called Eleanor.

Her PA answered. Eleanor was mid-flight to Sweden with Hal.

I called Norbert.

He answered immediately and without saying hello: \"Can you deliver FPP
on December 1st?\"

\"Realistically?

\"Of course, realistically,\" he said sharply. \"We are not playing
computer games. You do not have three lives to play with. I ask you
again: Will you deliver or not?\"

I didn\'t know what to say.

\"Yes or No. Quick.\"

\"No.\"

\"That\'s what I thought.\" The phone went silent for a minute. \"I
don\'t know if I can help you. If FPP doesn\'t ship, then Hal is gone.
It will be difficult for me to protect you under those circumstances.\"

He may has well have slapped me across the face. I\'d never thought of
Norbert as a friend; we were, professionally, closer than that. He was
my boss, but also my mentor and protector. After Fran died, it was
Norbert who pulled all the bureaucratic strings and corporate levers
necessary to transfer me from Glasgow to my current job in Watt\'s
Bridge, nearer my home. Eleanor hadn\'t wanted me---she wanted someone
with smaller ambitions than mine --- but he\'d insisted. In Wyxcomb, he
said, we looked after our own.

His words hurt. He knew the job market in Watt\'s Bridge for people like
me was limited. He knew my family situation and that commuting to either
Edinburgh or Glasgow was difficult for me, and that relocating my kids
and my mother was damned near out of the question.

I let my breath out. \"I need your help, Norbert.\"

He said nothing.

I waited another few seconds, then said, \"What should I do?\"

\"Your talk to your TCQ guy, Lally. Tell me how that went.\"

I chose my words carefully. \"He couldn\'t help me out with FPP. That
was, and still is, my priority. He wanted to help me prevent my next
FPP.\"

\"I spoke to him. He said your conversation was brief, that you seemed
reluctant to engage further but that you parted on good terms.\"

So Craig had kept his promise.

\"When I pressed him, he said he was sure he could help you, but that
you\'d have to ask for help if you wanted it.\"

\"Oh.\"

Norbert cleared his throat. \"My advice is for you to ask for his help.
Beg if you have to, but get his help.\"

I bit down on my lip for a moment before asking, \"But why him?\"

\"Because frankly, I don\'t know anyone else who wouldn\'t do precisely
what you\'ve already done. I am clutching at straws here. Maybe he can
see things the rest of us can\'t.\"

\"But what if he can\'t help me?\"

\"Then you\'re no worse off.\" He was silent for a moment. \"Maybe you
should start looking for a new job, Steve. Leave under your own terms.
You have a few months before things come to a head.\" Then he hung up.

I put the phone down and rested my head in my hands. The day had started
well, but then suddenly---due to circumstances beyond my control and
despite my loyalty to Wyxcomb and to my bosses---I\'d become expendable.

Eventually I looked up. Five very long minutes had passed. It felt like
more. I grabbed my phone, forced a smile on my face and dialed Craig
Lally. It was 3:56 p.m.
