Chapter 35
==========

And now there we were, all of us staring at the screen and waiting for
the hourglass to disappear and for Catherine to verify that the numbers
were all correct.

I glanced around the room. Everyone looked tense. There was a lot riding
on this. The first chunk was almost good enough to ship, fully tested
and reworked. All we needed to tip us from almost good enough to good
enough was Catherine\'s confirmation that she was happy.

Finally, the cursor returned to its normal shape---it felt like minutes,
but it could have only been seconds---and a small dialog box popped up,
confirming that the customer\'s application form had been processed.
Catherine clicked Okay, dismissing the dialog box, and swapped her
\"CSR\" hat for one that said \"CUSTOMER.\"

\"Now, where\'s my confirmation letter?\" she asked Tim.

Tim turned to Phil and nodded. Phil pressed a key on his laptop and the
laser printer behind him hummed into life. Gregor had \"borrowed\" the
printer from one of the production support teams. Fairness, as it
should, came a distant second to survival.

Phil looked around the room. \"This isn\'t a production environment, so
I\'ve redirected the confirmation letters to print here rather than
through the mail center.\" He took the papers from the printer and
passed them to Catherine, making a drum roll on his desk with his free
hand.

Catherine compared the confirmation letter with her application form,
then nodded her approval.

\"Right. Now, show me the money.\"

Phil turned to Colin, another developer, who sat beside Catherine with a
laptop open in front of him. Colin said, \"This is exactly the same
software you\'d find in production, except it\'s not connected to the
external banking system. Before I refresh the screen, can you check we
haven\'t cheated and that the screen shows no payments for this
customer?\"

I pushed back in my chair and watched Catherine take control of the
keyboard and check a few other things. She turned to me and said, with a
serious tone to her voice, \"Steven Abernethy, I am delighted with what
I have seen. I\'ve added a new basic-level customer, added their funds,
set up their first application and seen the papers and payments come
out. The functionality is, understandably, severely limited, but it does
now contain our most important features.\"

I nodded to myself. In the last three weeks we\'d identified just under
three hundred and fifty defects and fixed every bug that kept the
software from being judged good enough to ship. Many were caused by the
underlying faults with the messaging system, and were only fixed after
we flew three of the vendor\'s experts over from Australia.

Catherine smiled and looked around the room. \"You know everyone, I was
wondering if I\'d ever see a real live system. How long ago did I sign
off on the specifications for these screens? Was it nine months ago?
Twelve?\"

It was at least twelve months earlier, but we\'d started creating those
documents five months earlier.

Catherine continued. \"I cannot tell you how good this feels, to finally
get my hands on something concrete. I am so happy with everything I\'ve
seen and I\'m really looking forward to seeing the next chunk.\"

\"So is this chunk good enough to ship?\" I asked.

She paused for a moment, then nodded. \"You know, Steve. I do believe it
is.\"

I thought I heard the room\'s old-fashioned windows rattle in their
frames as everyone breathed out at once. The room came alive with mutual
back-slapping.

\"But,\" said Catherine, no longer smiling, \"this chunk took three
weeks, when we predicted it would take one or two. Sure, we crammed more
features in than we expected while we fixed the messaging system. But
that took us three weeks, and we have twelve remaining. That means we
took twenty percent of our remaining duration to deliver ten percent of
the scope. We need to double our speed, and then some, if we are going
to make it. Can we speed up?\"

I turned to Gregor. He turned to Tim. This was the testing phase, he was
the testing manager. We\'d agreed he should answer this question.

Tim stood. \"That\'s a fair point.\" I detected a tinge of nervousness
in his voice. \"This first chunk was always going to be the most
unpredictable and the slowest. We couldn\'t possibly know how long it
would take to complete, so we guessed.\" He laughed awkwardly. \"The
next chunk will be hard work too, but I think we will soon be running a
lot faster.\"

\"You *think*?\"

He frowned, then spoke slowly, as if he were giving complicated
directions to a foreign tourist. \"I say think, Catherine, because I
can\'t prove it. In the last three weeks we\'ve fixed a lot of serious
underlying problems which now we won\'t have to fix again. And we\'ve
been learning to work in this new way. The first few attempts when you
learn to ride a bike are always wobbly. We will speed up.\"

Catherine bit her lip before speaking. \"But \... you can\'t guarantee
we will have delivered a commercially viable product by December?\"

Tim looked at Gregor, then sat, handing him the baton.

\"Will we increase our speed enough so that the percentage of scope
delivered equals the percentage of time elapsed?\" He shrugged. \"I
honestly don\'t know. In another week, we\'ll know more. A week after
that, we\'ll know even more \...\"

\"Okay,\" said Catherine, looking sad. \"Can you track those two
percentages, over time? Put them on a chart, so everyone can see?\"

He said he would be glad to do that.

I said, \"Thank you, everyone, for your hard work,\" and the room slowly
emptied.

When just Catherine and I remained, she said, \"You know, I just wish a
month had already passed and we had a better idea of how fast we could
run.\"

\"I know.\"

I wished that Craig, who had inspired this situation, could have joined
in, but he was still on vacation.
