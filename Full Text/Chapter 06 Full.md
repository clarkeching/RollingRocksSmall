Chapter 6
=========

I sat at the head of the sixth-floor conference room table. I was a few
minutes early for the FPP weekly management meeting. The first to
arrive. The conference room looked like it came straight out of an
up-market 1990s conference room catalog: large oval wooden table, wooden
cupboards at the back of the room, dark brown carpet. But it was also
fitted with a few modern features. Whiteboards, a wired-in PC at the
front of the room, and a projector and screen helped usher the room into
the millennium.

I whiled away the minutes twiddling my thumbs and looking out the
window, admiring the castle perched atop Castle Peak, one of the city\'s
two intrusive crags. The castle looked formidable against its backdrop
of dark rain clouds. I grew bored with the castle very quickly---you\'ve
seen one, you\'ve seen \'em all---and turn my attention back inside the
building where I spied a large potted palm tree sitting just inside the
conference room door. I studied the palm for just a couple of seconds
before I came up with a plan: I would hide behind it, then jump out and
surprise people as they came into the meeting. My kids would have loved
that. I smiled at the thought but left it at that; I\'d save my surprise
for later in the meeting.

A few minutes later, Phil arrived. He\'d showered and shaved since I
last saw him, and he looked tired but presentable.

I said, \"Aren\'t you on vacation time?\"

He shrugged. \"Some things are more important.\"

Shortly after that, Gregor, FPP\'s project manager, burst into the room
lugging an old photocopy paper box. Gregor was a big, scary-looking guy,
barrel chested with a military-style haircut. If he had a personal life,
he\'d never mentioned it. Office rumor had it that he slept with the
lights on; not because he was scared of the dark, but because the dark
was scared of him. You wouldn\'t call him a people-person, but he was a
solid manager. Solid enough that I had entrusted him with FPP,
Wyx-Fin\'s biggest project in living memory.

His eyebrows shot up when he saw me sitting at the head of the table. I
wouldn\'t normally attend a meeting like this one, so I said this seemed
a quick way to catch up with my most important project. He\'d forgive my
lie when he knew the real reason.

Gregor sat at the other end of the table and placed the box on an empty
chair beside him. We made idle chit-chat as he removed a stack of
plastic folders and stapled papers from the box, then neatly sorted them
and arranged them into piles. The rest of his team slowly dribbled in
one by one. Vrinda, the lead analyst; Tim Phillips, the testing manager;
and Catherine MacDonald, FPP\'s customer rep. I greeted each as they
arrived and they congratulated me on my award. Word spread fast---and
whether that was good on not depended on the news.

Catherine said, \"Mark texted me. He said you have some news?\"

*Speaking of news.* \"Later.\"

I felt awkward. Catherine and Pauline used to lunch together, and I
thought they might have been friends outside of work, before Pauline
moved south. Before she betrayed us. My news was going to sting.

Gregor kicked off the meeting at five past the hour, as was unofficially
standard at Wyx-Fin. He picked up one of the piles of paper, kept the
top sheet for himself and passed one half of the stack to his left and
the other to his right. I ended up with a stack of spare sheets at my
end of the table. I pick one up and glanced at the heading. It was the
agenda.

\"Item one,\" said Gregor, \"is to review the project status.\" I
checked the agenda, and he was indeed correct. No one would accuse
Gregor of having agenda issues.

He picked up one of the larger stacks of paper, split it, then passed
stapled copies around the table. It was FPP\'s Gantt chart, showing the
project\'s detailed schedule.

Gregor summed up for me, \"As you can see, Steve, everything is
progressing on, or close to, schedule. We have just under three months
left of the development phase before we start integration testing.\"

I zoned out as Gregor worked through the plan, line by line, in his
nasal monotone, and read through it without his guidance. I kept one ear
open, just in case, listening for anything interesting. The analysis,
design and coding phases of the project\'s Gantt chart took up the first
half dozen pages. I turned quickly to the last two pages, which showed
the remaining coding tasks and then the integration testing which was
scheduled to start in a few months. Following that, we\'d start the
first of what could be several phases of testing.

I flipped back to the first page and then scanned the entire plan, my
finger tracing the shape as I took it all in. The project was
progressing to schedule, but that didn\'t mean we\'d ship on April
first. I knew we wouldn\'t. Gregor knew we wouldn\'t. Everyone else in
the room suspected we wouldn\'t. We couldn\'t know for sure until we
started testing.

That was how we motivated people: by keeping the pressure on. It didn\'t
actually work, because we almost always delivered late anyway, but I
hated to think how late we\'d deliver if we took the pressure off.

I tuned back into Gregor\'s update. \"Development work is continuing on
for the income projection statement and the audit history viewer. Both
tasks require another six weeks\' work each.\"

\"I still don\'t understand how come we\'re doing them at all?\" asked
Vrinda, the lead analyst on FPP and a long-time friend. She had dark
hair and was tall and athletically built. That day she wore a dress
suit. She never minced her words, but sometimes I thought she might have
achieved more if she had. \"They\'re low priority but they\'re taking up
twelve weeks\' of effort from two of our strongest developers. It\'s a
complete waste of time.\"

Gregor\'s face pinched, as if in pain. He let out a long, dismissive
sigh. \"For goodness sake, Vrinda, do we have to do this every time?
Both of these features were important enough to survive March\'s
descoping exercise so they cannot, by definition, be low priority. We
will build them.\"

\"But \...\" Vrinda protested.

\"But nothing. They\'re in the scope. That\'s it. The project doesn\'t
finish until they\'re finished. End of story.\"

He glared at her, holding her gaze until she blinked then grumbled
agreement.

I zoned out once again and let Gregor work his way through the plan. As
I waited, I studied the palm once more. There were three of them in this
room and dozens of other plants spread throughout our office. Our
facilities department hired those plants from a local company called
Lease-A-Plant. I guess someone in accounts described it as *outsourcing
their green capability*, or something like that. The first time I heard
their name mentioned, I thought they were talking about a person named
Lisa Plant---who I imagined was aging rock star Robert Plant\'s
daughter.

Gregor eventually finished and asked if there were any comments. When
there weren\'t, he glanced at me, no doubt wondering what I was really
doing there, and said, \"Right. Next up then, we have thirteen change
requests.\"

He distributed another pile of papers. I took one copy but put it to the
side. I didn\'t want to know the details. I already knew what would
happen next: arguments.

\"Only three pages today?\" asked Phil, sarcastically.

Gregor frowned. \"We should get through them in twenty to thirty
minutes.\"

\"Good,\" said Phil, \"because I\'m too tired for this today.\"

Gregor looked at the first page then frowned some more.

He looked towards Catherine then to me. \"I spoke to Catherine earlier,
and she has already agreed to close CR 315.\"

Catherine was a petite woman with long, deliberately wild, red hair. She
looked around the table with what I took to be an apologetic face. \"I
didn\'t realize it would require CORETRAN changes. There\'s a manual
workaround.\"

Catherine was a star. At the start of the project, Mark Richmond had
asked me what one thing I needed from him, as FPP\'s sponsor, to ensure
its success. I answered immediately: a top-notch customer---someone who
could provide our development staff with good quality, timely decisions;
someone Mark could comfortably delegate big decisions to so that he
didn\'t become a bottleneck; someone who wouldn\'t be intimidated by a
bunch of techies when they started speaking jargon. Mark\'s a sharp
cookie, and a few days later Catherine turned up in the FPP workspace
carrying six boxes of up-market donuts.

CORETRAN was the opposite of a star, whatever that is. A planet,
perhaps? (It certainly was a pain in Uranus.) It\'s our oldest software
systems and, as you can guess from the first part of its name, it sat at
the core of our software solution. It was hard to change CORETRAN. It
always had a big line of work waiting to be done to it, and over the
years we\'d all learned that the one rule with CORETRAN work was to
avoid it if at all possible.

Gregor sighed, again. \"I\'m horribly disappointed to see the next
change request. It\'s number 191, Customer Level Income. What\'s
happening, guys? We rejected this over six months ago and now it has
been reopened. Can someone explain, please?\"

I watched as Vrinda took a deep breath, then glanced across at Catherine
and Phil before speaking.

\"I reopened it, Gregor. We originally rejected it because, at
seventy-seven days\' work, it was too expensive. But Phil and I took a
closer look at it last week, answered a few outstanding questions, and
we think it will now only take ten to twenty days.\"

\"I asked them to,\" added Catherine. \"This is a very important change.
It simplifies the product, making it both easier to sell and to service.
If we were to write the requirements again, this would be right up near
the top of the list.\"

\"But, Catherine, it wasn\'t included in the original requirements. Not
even hinted at,\" said Gregor. \"You can\'t just make up features as you
go along.\"

\"We wouldn\'t have asked for it if it weren\'t important.\" She looked
at me and smiled. \"You guys make us go through so many administrative
hoops for each change that we only ever ask for the most important.\"

Gregor shook his head. \"Nonetheless, I am rejecting it. If we do it
then we risk delaying the integration work.\"

\"Could we swap it for something?\" suggested Catherine. \"There are
several other features I would happily drop if it meant we could get
this approved.\"

Vrinda said, \"The audit functionality we just discussed, for
instance.\"

\"We can\'t do that,\" said Gregor. \"Colin is already halfway through
the work, and I\'m not throwing away good work. I\'m sorry, but the best
I can do is add it to the phase two wish list. How\'s that?\"

Catherine and Vrinda looked at each other, shrugged, then nodded in
defeat. We all knew the odds of phase two ever happening on any project
were low, but they were even lower on a project that was already running
late.

I saw Gregor put a large *X* next to the change request. There were
plenty more to come.

I glanced at the clock on the wall. I didn\'t need---or want---to hear
any more. I knew what would happen next: Gregor would protect his budget
and delivery date; Catherine would protect her product; some requests
would be approved; many would be rejected; others would be approved with
a watered-down solution. It wasn\'t pretty, but what could you do?

I smiled to myself as Gregor tidied the papers in front of him. He asked
if anyone had any further questions. No one did, so he turned to me and
asked if I had any questions.

I said, \"No, but I have some news.\"
