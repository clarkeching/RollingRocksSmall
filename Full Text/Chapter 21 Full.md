Chapter 21
==========

The sunlight blinded me as Phil and I walked out of the gloomy pub.
Declan was waiting outside, sucking on what looked like an orange
plastic cigar. I presumed it was a nicotine replacement device designed
specifically for extraverts.

Spotting us, he asked \"You got a minute, Stevie-boy?\"

Phil politely excused himself and rushed ahead to join the others.
Declan reached inside his jacket pocket, pulled out another plastic
cigar---this one lime-green---and offered it to me.

I shook my head, and he pretended to be offended then pretended to stub
his cigar out. \"I gave up cigarettes and now I\'m addicted to these.\"

We started walking slowly back towards the office.

He said, \"That pub\'s beer is vile.\"

Declan held very strong opinions about many things, but none more so
than beer. He was born and bred in Watt\'s Bridge. It would be wrong
literally to say that Declan was born on the wrong side of the tracks,
because in Watt\'s Bridge the train lines hugged the coast and that
would mean he was born at sea. But figuratively it was true. Declan grew
up in one of the poorer parts of town with the hard-working have-nots.
He studied hard, worked harder and played very little, and nowadays he
made a good living working for me as a programmer. He was also my
department\'s unpaid employee rep. The position was meant to be,
essentially toothless, but Declan hadn\'t realized that.

Declan prided himself on speaking plainly. \"Your Gregor has righteously
messed this one up.\"

\"He\'s just doing his job.\"

Declan told me, formally, that formally speaking he wasn\'t having this
conversation and formally speaking he wasn\'t even in the pub, but that
informally he wasn\'t happy. He hoped to keep things nice and informal.
To keep things *within the family*.

I told him that both formally and informally I wasn\'t happy either. I
didn\'t tell him about Hal\'s threat. Declan was fair, all things
considered, but he was an adversary. Although I respected his
intentions, he seemed to think his job was to protect my staff from me
and I didn\'t like that about him.

Neither of us spoke as we walked up St John\'s Wynd towards the High
Street intersection. Watt\'s Bridge is, according to the tourist books,
one of the most pedestrian-friendly cities in Europe, but even the
traffic lights were against me that day.

As we waited, I turned to face Declan. \"Look Dec, I am taking a long
walk with Gregor this afternoon. There will be no forced overtime and
vacations are un-cancelled. If you want to lay a formal complaint, well,
that\'s your choice.\"

I held his stare for a moment. He held mine. He nodded. \"We\'re okay.\"

The pedestrian lights changed. As we crossed the road, he said, \"You
look terribly tired, Steve.\"

I shrugged and said nothing. I felt terribly tired. Too tired to talk
about it. My shoulders ached from the weights I carried with me that
day.

We walked a short distance up then turned up St Josephine\'s Close,
which was a shortcut to the Wyx-Fin HQ staff entrance. When we reached
the entrance, Declan reached into his jacket, pulled out his orange
cigar and said, \"I\'ll leave you here then.\" He pointed towards the
smoking shelter. \"I need a smoke.\"

\"You know there are no rules against sucking on that thing inside,
right?\"

He smiled and tipped his head towards the gossiping huddle at the
smoking station. \"If I did that, how ever would I find out what\'s
really going on in this place?\"

He leaned in and spoke confidentially. \"If you ever feel like a pint or
two one evening, Steve, perhaps a bag of crisps or even a little fish
stew,\" ---as far back as Victorian times, folk have traveled up to
Watt\'s bridge to enjoy our famous seaweed bath spas and eat our fish
stew---\"then I\'m in the phone book.\"

Call his home number. Not his work number. An informal pint.

\"Thanks,\" I said. \"Really. Thanks.\"

We left it at that. He headed towards the smoking shelter, but I had
barely swiped my card to go through the revolving door when I heard him
shouting. \"Steve! Steve!\"

I backed away from the door and turned to see Declan rushing towards me.

\"The lads just told me that Chaste International just announced
they\'re launching their new product on February 1st,\" he panted. Good
thing he had switched to those orange cigars.

\"No way.\"

\"And worse, Hal has just issued a press release announcing that we\'re
launching our product for sale on December 1st.\"

December 1st. That made no sense. No one would buy the product until
April when the new tax year started. And, he\'d just robbed me and my
team of two months. Why would Hal do that? There was only one reason I
could think of.

Hal had just declared war on Chaste.

And I and my team were the collateral damage.

I decided, there and then, to go upstairs and explain to Hal precisely
what an arsehole he was.
