Chapter 58
==========

Hal waited for the applause to die down before he cut Mark off at the
knees.

\"Why this timid drip-drip-drip rollout? What are you afraid of, Mark?\"

If someone in the audience had a pin and they decided to drop it, then
you would almost certainly have heard it drop. Hal seemed genuinely
surprised and angry, as if he didn\'t know about the incremental
rollout. I had assumed Mark had filled Hal in, but apparently not. It
looked like Mark had decided to seek forgiveness rather than permission.
Either that or Hal was a very good actor.

Mark\'s smile fell and a frown rolled down to take its place. His face
hardened. He pulled his hands up in front of him to chest level, joined
his fingers to form a steeple, and placed his index fingers against his
lips. The entertainer had left the building; the thinker had taken his
place. He extended his hands, still steepled, out toward Hal in the
unmistakable shape of a revolver.

\"An excellent question, Hal.\" He nodded toward Catherine then smiled
graciously. \"There are two excellent reasons, which my colleague
Catherine will now explain.\"

Catherine took Mark\'s place at the lectern and fired up a presentation.
We had, apparently, returned to the script.

The first slide showed a picture of a chubby toddler supporting himself
with his hand holding on to the front edge of a couch. In nice contrast
to the earlier parts of the presentation, which had been professionally
constructed by Mark\'s media team, this photo was obviously an amateur
snapshot.

\"This is my nephew, Hamish. He\'s about eighteen months old in this
photo, and at that stage between crawling and walking. Not many weeks
later, though, he was walking. And not long after that, running.\"

She paused for effect, and then words appeared under Hamish\'s picture.

WALK BEFORE YOU RUN.

\"We chose to rollout incrementally, in a safe, prudent and focused
manner, starting with our local Watt\'s Bridge branches. They\'re close
by and we already have excellent relationships with the staff. In return
for getting a head start selling Wyx-Fin\'s hottest new product, the
local branch will help shape our sales approach, our processes and
training material. Like wee Hamish, we are learning to walk so that when
we need to run, in April, we can.\"

She spent another minute explaining how this would work, carefully
forgetting to mention that the process and training documentation
hadn\'t been written yet.

She clicked and Hamish faded away. He was replaced with a stock
photograph of a racing team pit crew busy changing tires.

\"The second advantage of our incremental rollout---and this I believe
is truly innovative, something that the entire Wyxcomb Group and perhaps
even Chaste Financials will one day emulate---is that although our
product is already live, we\'ve not yet finished developing it.\"

She paused deliberately, giving the audience time to think. How could we
be live when the product wasn\'t finished yet?

\"We\'re using the staggered rollout to test our real, live product with
real, live staff and real, live customers. We want to see who buys the
product and who doesn\'t, why they do and why they don\'t.\"

She glanced at Mark and he added, \"There\'s nothing like the sound of
cash registers ringing to confirm that your customers want your
product.\"

Catherine continued. \"When we find something we don\'t like, something
we could do better, then we fix it. If it\'s process related, we will
fix the process. If it\'s sales related, we\'ll fix the sales process;
and if it needs software changes then Steve\'s team is primed---like the
pit crew you see on the screen behind us---and ready to pounce on any
changes we request and implement them immediately.

\"And when is the best time for us as a business to learn and adapt like
this? When it\'s easy and cheap, with minimum impact to staff and
customers. And when specifically is that? When we have our dedicated IT
pit crew standing by and when we only have a few branches up and running
with only a few live customers.\"

And, I thought, when the product is so small it\'s easy to change.

Catherine stepped aside and Mark took her place.

He looked directly at Hal, but spoke as if addressing the entire
audience. \"We\'ve got a great product, folks, but we\'ll keep making it
better by listening to our customers\' feedback and listening for the
cash registers\' rings. Every new product launch is a bet, and FPP is,
for us, a bigger bet than most. This staggered rollout loads the dice in
our favor.\"

Mark stopped talking and stood there, staring directly at Hal and
challenging him to say something nice.

Moments passed.

Then, finally, Hal stood up. He turned to face the entire room. He
nodded to Mark and Catherine, then looked up, found me in the back row,
and nodded once more.

He pivoted back to face Mark.

\"Your team has done excellent work. Though, frankly,\" he said, before
turning and speaking directly to me, \"your website is pig-ugly. Not
your finest hour, Steven.\"

I smiled. Pig-ugly was an apt description, and if that was the worst he
could say then that was a victory. Four weeks earlier we didn\'t even
have a web app. In two weeks\' time the site would look a little
prettier. Come March, who knew what it would look like?

I looked around the audience and beamed. Few of them knew what the FPP
team had achieved. None knew that I would soon rollout the lessons we\'d
learned rescuing FPP to other, new Wyx-Fin projects. Not to rescue them,
but to set them up to succeed. That was my little secret.

Professionally speaking, I\'d never felt more proud or fulfilled in my
life as I did at that moment, and I wasn\'t going to let Hal\'s comment
bother me.

I said, \"Thank you, Hal. We are very proud of what we\'ve achieved.\"

He nodded, then said, \"Right, back to work everyone, then.\"

As the crowd slowly dispersed, Eleanor rested her hand on my lower arm,
indicating I should wait with her.
