# 😲 Pivot Point: The Inverted Pyramid

**End of Act 2a → Midpoint → Start of Act 2b**

---

## What Happens

Steve has learned all the pieces - the Evaporating Cloud, the Dog Food Problem, Small Batches, the French Fry Revelation - but he can't connect them to software. He's been "trying not to think about small batches" and failing.

Then, alone in his attic, reading about journalism and "Made to Stick," it clicks:

> Newspapers put the most important paragraph first - the "lede" - because telegraph transmissions were unreliable. Deliver the most important thing first.

The Inverted Pyramid. Deliver the most important features first. Each delivery "good enough to ship."

## Why It Matters

This is Steve's own French Fry Revelation - the moment where all the lessons suddenly connect into something he can *use*.

Before: He knew the theory but couldn't apply it.
After: He has a concrete method to save the project.

## The Shift

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Knows concepts | Has a method |
| Desperate and stuck | Has a plan |
| Theory | Practice |
| "Can't see how this helps" | "I want us to invert FPP" |

## The Key Insight

> "I want us to invert FPP by delivering the most important paragraph first, then the next most important paragraph, and so on until we hit December 1st."

> "Good enough to ship. We still won't ship until December 1st, but I want the code and documentation for each small chunk fully tested, fully reworked and good enough quality that we could ship it, were it time."
