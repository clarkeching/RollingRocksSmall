## Overview

**Protagonist:** [[Steve Abernethy|Steven J. Abernethy]], development manager at Wyxcomb Financials (Wyx-Fin)

**Time span:** August 3rd to November 18th (about 3.5 months)
**Core conflict:** Deliver an "impossible" software project (FPP) ahead of a competitor while learning that quality and speed aren't trade-offs

---

## Act One: Setup
**Chapters 1-21** | ~25,000 words (34%)

### The Setup
[[Steve Abernethy|Steve]] returns from a Singapore conference to devastating news from [[Phil McDermott|Phil]] (his best friend since age thirteen): their former lead analyst Pauline has been poached by Chaste Group. She's helping them build a competitor to FPP, launching April 1st—the same day as Wyx-Fin's already-late planned launch.

### The Impossible Date
CEO [[Halifax Gibbet|Hal]] promises Group they'll beat Chaste to market. The new deadline: February 1st. Two months stolen from an already impossible schedule. FPP is Hal's "get-out-of-jail-free card"—his job is on the line.

### The Teacher Arrives
[[Craig Lally|Craig Lally]] meets Steve for brunch in the staff cafeteria. Craig is late-50s, tieless in a functional grey suit, looks like a mountain climber, and walks with a limp. His title: Flow Master. He introduces the [[Evaporating Cloud|Evaporating Cloud]]—a thinking tool for visualizing and resolving conflicts.

### The Kitchen Lessons
Craig takes Steve to meet [[Cheryl|Cheryl]], the cafeteria manager. Through her story, Steve learns:
1. **[[Dog Food Problem|The Dog Food Problem]]** - "No one ever tasted it before serving it... frankly—we didn't care."
2. **[[Late vs In Process Inspection|Late vs. In-Process Inspection]]** - Build quality in during the process, not at the end.

### Personal Stakes
Steve's wife Fran passed away two-and-a-half years earlier. His mother moved in to help raise daughters Ashley (7) and Alison (~4). Steve never expected to be living with his mom in his early forties.

### 😲 [[Pivot 1 Boats Burned|PIVOT: Hal Burns His Boats]]
Chaste announces they're launching February 1st. Hal responds with a press release: Wyx-Fin will launch December 1st. This isn't for the newspapers—it's a message. Hal has burned his boats. And Steve's too.

> *"He's declared war against Chaste?"*

---

## Act 2a: Response
**Chapters 22-32** | ~12,500 words (17%)

### Desperate and Humbled
The team reels from the December 1st announcement. Steve knows the concepts but can't connect them to software. He's stuck.

### More Kitchen Lessons
Steve returns to [[Cheryl|Cheryl]]. This time he listens:
- **[[Small Batches|Small Batches]]** - Craig plants the idea with a paradoxical instruction: "Try not to think about small batches."
- **[[French Fry Revelation|The French Fry Revelation]]** - Why do they never run out of chips AND rarely throw any away? "Our serving staff keeps an eye on how many chips they've got out front, and when it gets too low, they shout out and we cook more."

### Discovery and Setbacks
Steve researches, talks with [[Phil McDermott|Phil]] and [[Ron McKnight|Ron]], struggles to connect the lessons. Cheryl describes it: "It was like I was an oyster and he'd planted a bit of grit inside my shell, hoping I'd turn it into a pearl."

### 😲 [[Pivot 2 Inverted Pyramid|PIVOT: The Inverted Pyramid]]
In his attic, Steve sees a newspaper folded with the headline "above the fold." He finds "Made to Stick" and discovers the [[Inverted Pyramid|Inverted Pyramid]]—how 19th-century journalists solved unreliable telegraph transmissions by putting the most important content first.

> *"There it is: the inverted pyramid."*

---

## 💡 Midpoint: The Inverted Pyramid
**Chapters 33-34** | ~4,800 words (6%)

Steve presents the breakthrough to the team:
- "I want us to invert FPP by delivering the most important paragraph first, then the next most important paragraph, and so on until we hit December 1st."
- Each chunk must be [[Good Enough to Ship|"good enough to ship"]]—fully tested, fully reworked, ready to release even though they won't ship until December 1st

Everything clicks. The concepts connect. Steve has found the method.

---

## Act 2b: Attack
**Chapters 35-49** | ~20,700 words (28%)

### The New Way of Working
- Daily standups
- [[Small Batches|Small batches]] of features
- Testing integrated throughout (not a separate phase)
- [[Catherine MacDonald|Catherine]] actively prioritizing in real-time
- [[Gregor|Gregor]] must adapt from command-and-control to facilitation

### The Mutiny
[[Gregor|Gregor]] pushes the team too hard with overtime. There's a walkout. Steve intervenes. The crisis forces everyone to commit to sustainable pace—the new way requires treating people differently.

### 😲 [[Pivot 3 Four Million|PIVOT: Eleanor Reveals £4 Million]]
[[Eleanor Scharlau|Eleanor]] calls Steve with a question he hasn't considered: what are the *financial* implications of delivering early?

Eight months of unexpected sales × £500,000/month = **£4 million**.

> *"I, with some help, had just made a significant contribution to the Group's finances."*

---

## Act 3: Resolution
**Chapters 50-61** | ~11,900 words (16%)

### The Home Stretch
- Mutiny resolved, sustainable pace established
- Core product functional
- Quality surprisingly high (defects caught early)
- The "gift-wrapped pig" conversation—turning apparent failure into opportunity

### Launch Day
Friday, November 17th: FPP launches successfully—**two weeks early**—beating Chaste to market.

### The Choice
Steve faces Hal and Eleanor. Norbert wants him for a Group role with more travel. Wyx-Fin needs him to stay. Steve applies the [[Evaporating Cloud|Evaporating Cloud]] to his own life and finds the third option.

### 😲 [[Pivot 4 Bacon and Cards|PIVOT: Bacon, Kids, and Holding the Cards]]
Saturday, November 18th: Steve wakes up hungover. His daughter says his breath stinks. His mum makes him a bacon sandwich. He watches his kids play in the garden.

He's brokered a deal: stay in Watt's Bridge, keep his family together, teach others how to invert projects. Norbert's people can fly to *him*.

> *"Fran would be proud of you."*
>
> That was the best thing anyone could ever say to him.
