# Act 2a: RESPONSE (Chapters 22-32)
## "Learning the Tools"

### Chapter 22: Chickening Out

Steve rides the elevator planning to tell Hal exactly what an arsehole he is—but somewhere between the second and fourth floors, he chickens out. Pushes the button for sixth floor instead of the penthouse.

He lays down the law to Gregor: no compulsory overtime, no cancelled vacations. Gregor asks: *"What would you have done differently?"*

Steve realizes Gregor's right. He apologizes.

He calls Eleanor—she's mid-flight to Sweden with Hal. So he calls **[[Norbert Billings|Norbert]]**.

Norbert's first words: *"Can you deliver FPP on December 1st?"*

Steve: *"No."*

Norbert: *"That's what I thought."* Then, coldly: *"If FPP doesn't ship, Hal is gone. It will be difficult for me to protect you."*

The words hit Steve like a slap. Norbert is his mentor, his protector—the one who pulled strings to transfer him to Watt's Bridge after Fran died. Now even Norbert is abandoning him.

Norbert's advice: *"Talk to Lally. Beg if you have to."*

Steve swallows his pride and calls Craig. It's 3:56 PM.

### Chapter 23: Craig Returns

Craig is reluctant—he's got his son's wedding this weekend and he's going on vacation for three weeks. But he gives Steve ten minutes.

Steve pours out his desperation. Craig sums it up: *"Your concern is you don't know if you can keep your promise."*

Craig makes a phone call to Norbert, then calls Steve back: *"I've cleared my diary. Meet me in the cafeteria in twenty minutes. Bring your FPP folder."*

---

### Chapter 24: Don't Think About Small Batches

Steve meets Craig in the cafeteria. Craig tells him Norbert said if Steve walks out again, Norbert will fly there and take over his job.

Craig has one rule: *"Do not think about small batches. Okay?"*

*"Small what?"*

*"Batches. Don't think about them."*

---

### Chapter 25: The French Fry Revelation

Cheryl welcomes Steve back—cautiously. She tells him about the **French Revelation** (short for French Fry Revelation).

Two problems the cafeteria had:
1. **Food deteriorated** because they cooked it too far in advance in big batches
2. **Forecasting was impossible**—some days too much food, some days not enough

Cheryl describes two-hour-old cabbage. Overproduction (wasted food) and underproduction (lost sales). *"On some days we'd do both—too much soup but not enough lasagna."*

Steve asks: *"What was the obvious solution?"*

He doesn't know. Neither did they. That's when they had their French Fry Revelation.

---

### Chapter 26: Cook to Demand

Cheryl takes them to the deep fryers.

*"Unspoken rule Number One: Don't run out of chips. Rule Two: Don't serve cold chips."*

The revelation: *"Our serving staff keeps an eye on how many chips they've got out front, and when it gets too low, they shout out and we cook more."*

Craig calls this **"replenish on demand."**

Cheryl switched to cooking vegetables in small batches. The first day was nuts. The second day was less nuts. Things kept getting better.

Now they prep vegetables before lunch rush, cook a first small batch just before noon, and servers shout when they need more. If it's busy, they cook larger batches based on demand.

Results: 30% more customers, 40% more revenue. They saved their jobs.

Steve: *"So cooking small batches not only improved your product quality, it also solved your forecasting problem."*

*"Exactly!"* says Cheryl.

---

### Chapter 27: The Lesson

Back in the cafeteria, Craig explains: *"We could spend hours debating whether lessons from a kitchen apply to software. But we don't have time."*

They'll skip the debates and figure out whether the lessons apply.

Steve says his team already does extensive in-process inspection.

Craig: *"Did in-process inspections fully eliminate quality issues in the kitchen?"*

*"No. They improved further when they switched to small batches."*

---

### Chapter 28: Requirements Are Forecasts

Craig asks about forecasting problems. Steve admits FPP's requirements document is really just a forecast—a prediction of what they'd need.

Craig picks up the 312-page requirements folder and weighs it. *"These things you call requirements—I don't think that word means what you think it means."*

If they were genuinely *required*, how could Catherine descope them? They're more like requests or guesses.

*"When your team wrote this document, it was in fact a forecast, nothing more than a prediction."*

Steve gets defensive: *"You're playing word games with me!"*

Craig: *"Forecasts, by definition, will sometimes be right and will sometimes be wrong; otherwise we'd call them facts."*

The lesson: *"You can blame yourselves when your forecasted requirements are wrong, or you can change the way you work so it matters less."*

---

### Chapter 29: Overproduction and Underproduction

Steve explains how Catherine descoped three payment methods—built but not tested. They're throwing away work, just like Cheryl threw away unsold food. **Overproduction.**

Craig: *"And I bet your customers know the game and only ask for the most important changes?"*

*"Of course."*

Craig says he has good news and bad news. Bad: He has a wedding rehearsal. Good: *"You have all the pieces of the jigsaw in your brain."*

Steve's homework: Draw the overproduction cloud. Review the earlier clouds. Then think about small batches.

Craig's final hint: *"You've already identified your first two slightly smaller batches."*

Steve realizes: *"My first batch ends on December 1st! And the second starts immediately afterwards!"*

---

### Chapter 30: Things Change

Steve drives home thinking about Fran, their early married life, the aerial photographs of Watt's Bridge at the museum. The town has changed over decades. Some things stay constant (the Castle). Other things appear and disappear.

*"Things change. That is the nature of life."*

He arrives home to find Scouts marching across the estate grounds and marquees being assembled at the Mansion.

---

### Chapter 31: Washing Up Epiphanies

Steve does the dishes while thinking through the clouds. Mom cooked mushroom risotto. He works through pros and cons of building many features vs. building only high-value features.

He realizes: There's a natural priority within customers' requirements. They only say everything is top priority because they feel compelled to **hoard**.

*"There must be a way to get our customers to prioritize. If I can do that, then I can break the vicious circle."*

---

### Chapter 32: Small Batches = Small Projects

Steve finds Ashley's bowl half-full of soggy cornflakes—she always takes more than she needs. Just like customers hoarding features.

He decides to stop using the word "requirements" and use **features** instead.

The insight builds: Could working in small batches be as simple as breaking a medium-sized project into a bunch of smaller projects?

*"How disappointingly dull. I'd expected thunderclaps and awe, or maybe a Eureka Moment where I jumped out of my office and ran naked down the street."*

But it felt right.

*"Small batches were small projects. But that still didn't help me with the prioritization problem."*

Or did it? What if instead of asking customers to prioritize twelve months of work, they asked them to prioritize just the first month?

*"Yes. Small batches would force our customers to prioritize."*

---

## 😲 PIVOT: Steve has all the pieces. He just needs the final insight.

> *"Craig was right; small batches were key. But a key is useless without someone to put it in the lock, turn it, and then yank the door open."*
