# 😲 Pivot Point: Bacon, Kids, and Holding the Cards

**End of Act 3 - Resolution**

---

## What Happens

Steve wakes up hungover after the FPP launch party. His daughter tells him his breath stinks. His mum makes him a bacon sandwich. He watches his kids playing in the garden.

He's brokered a deal: he stays in Watt's Bridge, keeps his family together, and teaches others how to invert projects. Norbert's people can fly to *him*.

> "Fran would be proud of you."

That was the best thing anyone could ever say to him.

## Why It Matters

This isn't just a work victory - it's a personal transformation. Steve started the book jet-lagged, eating bacon at 4am, missing his kids. He ends it eating bacon at home, watching his kids play, having solved both problems:

1. The impossible project (FPP delivered early)
2. His impossible life (no more travel, family first)

He used the Evaporating Cloud on *himself* - finding a way to have the career AND the family.

## The Shift

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Jet-lagged, alone | Home with family |
| Bacon at 4am in airports | Bacon in his kitchen |
| Missing his kids | Watching them play |
| Career vs family | Career AND family |
| "I could live without bacon" | He doesn't have to |

## The Real Victory

> "I really did love the taste of bacon, but if I ever had to, I thought I could live without it."

He doesn't have to choose. He found the third option.
