# Part One: The Impossible Deadline

## Bacon and Bad News

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve, jet-lagged and eating bacon at 5:26am, learns from his best friend Phil that their former colleague Pauline has been poached by competitor Chaste—and she's helping them build a copycat of FPP.*

So let me tell you about Steve Abernethy.

It's 5:26 in the morning on the first Thursday in August, and Steve's sitting in Luca's café in Watt's Bridge, Scotland. He's jet-lagged—just back from Singapore—and he's working through his three-step recovery routine: espresso, bacon, work. The bacon comes from Belfast. The eggs are local. And the espresso is the kind of thick black tar that makes everything else feel manageable.

Then his phone rings. It's Phil McDermott, his chief programmer and best friend since they were thirteen. Phil has never been a morning person, so this is strange.

"You okay?"

"I'll be there in about two minutes. I've got bad news, Steve. Can you order me breakfast? Please. And coffee. Lots of coffee."

Steve caught Luca's eye. "Can you cook me up another breakfast, same order? Phil's joining me."

Luca paused, glanced across at the table of taxi drivers who'd been waiting, and smiled to himself. "I'll have both plates ready in one minute."

Phil shows up looking like a bald, malnourished version of Paul McCartney, reeking of stale cigarettes and alcohol. He'd been out the night before for pre-wedding drinks when Pauline—their former lead analyst who'd supposedly moved to Birmingham to care for her sick mother-in-law—got drunk and let something slip.

She'd been poached. By Chaste Group. To build a copycat version of FPP—Future Perfect Project—the top-secret product Steve's team had been building for over a year. And Chaste was launching on April 1st, the same date Wyx-Fin was planning.

But Pauline didn't know FPP was running late. She thought they were on track for April. Which meant Chaste would beat them to market.

Luca arrived with two fully-loaded plates. He grinned and tilted his head toward the cabbies. "Thank them. Your need seemed greater."

Phil looked down at his empty coffee cup. "She was a friend."

Steve grimaced. He didn't know what else to say. They finished their food in silence.

## February 1st

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve checks the project status—April was always a stretch, October more realistic—then calls CFO Eleanor Scharlau to break the news about Pauline.*

Steve made his way to his office. Wyx-Fin HQ sat just off the High Street, and his department was relegated to the sixth floor, where his prestigious corner office had its sea view blocked by a thoughtlessly placed parking garage.

Before he could do anything else, he needed to get his story straight. He pulled up FPP's status reports—both of them. The public one said April 1st was "aggressive but achievable," which was code for *This date isn't really feasible, but we need to keep the pressure on, otherwise they'll slack off.* The management-eyes-only version said they were tracking toward October or November.

So nothing had changed. April was nine months away, but they needed at least fifteen.

He called Eleanor Scharlau, the CFO. She didn't do small talk.

"Steven. This is early. What's up?"

He told her about Pauline.

"Can we beat them?"

"Yes, I believe so. But it'll be very, very tight. We'll have to make the usual compromises."

"Come up and see me at noon."

She hung up.

## The Rabbit, the Cow, and the Top Hat

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Eleanor delivers devastating news: CEO Halifax Gibbet has promised the launch date is now February 1st. FPP is Hal's get-out-of-jail-free card—and Steve realizes who'll get blamed if it fails.*

At noon, Steve stepped out of the elevator into the penthouse foyer. He'd barely sat down on the leather couch when Halifax Gibbet—the CEO, five foot six inches tall and round—stomped out of Eleanor's office barking "No more excuses!" and marched straight past without acknowledging Steve's existence.

Ten minutes later, Eleanor led Steve into her office and pointed him toward her couch—a short-legged, luxurious, antique thing, not unlike its owner. He sank into the soft cushions, felt his pant legs ride up, and tried not to think about how this meeting was going to go.

Eleanor got straight to the point. "Hal promised Group we would beat Chaste to market. Our new launch date is February 1st."

"February? I agreed to match them, not beat them."

"He can, and—in fact—he just has." She spoke quietly, coldly. "The date isn't open for debate."

Steve's mind raced. April would have been tight, but February? There's only so much functionality you can slash before the product is no longer commercially viable. There's only so much overtime before people burn out. And bringing new people onto a late project just slows everyone down. The only option left was to cut quality even more than usual.

"We might not make February," Steve said. "We need a Plan B."

Eleanor glanced at the open door. "Halifax promised our masters two things. First, we will be selling FPP on February 1st. Second, we will be selling at scale in April. He promised he would deliver, or else."

"Or else?"

"You figure it out."

It wasn't difficult. No one said it, but everyone knew Hal's job was on the line. FPP was the rabbit up his sleeve, his get-out-of-jail-free card and his rescue plan all rolled into one. The Wyxcomb Group had been pumping cash into them for the last three years. They described it as investing for growth, but really, for all the growth they'd seen so far (exactly none), they were keeping Wyx-Fin afloat. FPP was not only the rabbit up Halifax's sleeve, but also his future cash cow. No rabbit, no cow; no cash, no job. No job, no shirt on his back. No shirt, no sleeves, nowhere to hide his rabbit. Or something like that. Maybe the analogy makes more sense with top hats.

Eleanor stood. "When you leave my office, you need to leave with a beaming smile on your face. As far as you are concerned, February 1st is just the sort of kick in the pants your guys needed."

Then, as Steve reached the door, she asked one last question.

"Tell me, who normally gets blamed when a software-intensive initiative like FPP fails? The CEO, the CFO, or the IT guys?"

## Gravity Sucks

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *We learn Steve is a widower—his wife Fran died two years ago, leaving him with two young daughters and his mum who moved in to help. The work crisis lands on someone already carrying grief.*

Now, here's the thing about Steve that you need to know.

He's a widower. His wife Fran died of a brain aneurysm two-and-a-half years earlier while they were vacationing in Rome. They'd only been married three years. Their girls—Ashley, seven, and Alison, four—were still very young. Steve's mum flew to Rome and helped sort things out, then took early retirement and moved in with them. She'd been looking after the family ever since.

So Steve's already carrying grief when this impossible work situation lands on him.

He called his mum to say he'd be late home.

"Oh, Steven. The kids haven't even seen you yet."

"I know. I'm sorry."

He started to explain about Pauline, but his mum interrupted.

"Pauline? Short? Mousey hair? A bit dumpy?"

"You only met her twice."

"Yes. But I didn't like her either time."

"She was a friend," Steve said quietly.

"I don't imagine, then, that she betrayed you lightly."

"My poor boy," she said. "You've all worked so long on this project."

"It'll be okay."

Steve put down the phone and looked out his office window. It was raining heavily outside, which didn't help his mood. He watched as, one after another, plump raindrops rolled down the glass.

*Drip. Drip. Drip.*

Gravity sucks.

## Nibbled to Death by Ducklings

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve's Group CIO boss Norbert nags him—again—about meeting the local Quality guy, Craig Lally. Steve avoids it, thinking the last thing he needs is manufacturing advice from people who got outsourced.*

Before the FPP management meeting, Steve called his other boss—his dotted-line boss—Norbert Billings, the Wyxcomb Group CIO. Norbert was tall, blonde and Dutch, and had worked within the company for decades. Steve gave him a quick update on the FPP situation. Norbert had already heard the news. He offered no direction or advice, only a request that Steve keep him up to date.

Then Norbert blindsided him. "Now, tell me, did you ever contact Craig Lally?"

Craig Lally was the local Quality guy—one of those process improvement people Norbert had been pushing on the subsidiaries. Months earlier, Norbert had asked Steve and his counterparts to meet with their local Quality teams to explore how they could improve their development practices.

Steve knew someone in Wyxcomb Health had contacted this Craig Lally fellow, and they'd ended up outsourcing their entire development team. He did not want to be outsourced.

"No. Not yet. We've been particularly busy lately."

"Funny, your colleagues in the other subsidiaries have been particularly busy too. Did you, at least, read the report he wrote up about his Wyx-Health work?"

"Ahhh, no, not fully, not yet."

Sometimes working for Norbert felt like being nibbled to death by ducklings. A little nip here—*You don't ask for enough help*; a little nip there—*Have you read this report*? None of the nips hurt individually, but over time...

"Yeah. I know. You're right," Steve said out loud, trying to sound suitably respectful while saying *nip, nip, nip* in his head. "I'll call him. But FPP's management meeting starts in a few minutes. I really have to go."

Norbert sighed. They ended the call. Steve glanced at the edge of Craig Lally's report poking out from a pile on his desk and chose to ignore it. The last thing he needed was a bunch of manufacturing guys who'd lost their jobs because their factories had been closed down trying to help him.

He had a very important meeting to gate-crash.

## Lisa Plant

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve gate-crashes the FPP management meeting. We meet the key players: scary project manager Gregor, outspoken analyst Vrinda, tester Tim, and customer rep Catherine with her wild red hair.*

Steve gate-crashed the FPP management meeting.

The team gathered in the sixth-floor conference room: Gregor, the project manager—big, scary-looking, barrel-chested with a military-style haircut (office rumor had it he slept with the lights on, not because he was scared of the dark, but because the dark was scared of him); Vrinda, the lead analyst and Steve's old friend who never minced her words; Tim Phillips from testing; and Catherine MacDonald, the customer rep with deliberately wild red hair.

Steve sat at the head of the table, half-listening to Gregor drone through the Gantt chart, zoning out to study a potted palm tree by the door. There were three of them in this room and dozens of other plants spread throughout the office. Facilities hired them from a local company called Lease-A-Plant. The first time Steve heard their name mentioned, he thought they were talking about a person named Lisa Plant—who he imagined was aging rock star Robert Plant's daughter.

He came up with a plan to hide behind the palm and jump out to surprise people as they arrived. His kids would have loved that. He smiled at the thought but left it at that; he'd save his surprise for later in the meeting.

When Gregor finished, he asked if there were any questions.

Steve said, "No, but I have some news."

## The War Room

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve breaks the news about the new deadline. He gives them 24 hours to create a recovery plan, warning them that quality is now negotiable—"this baby will be born premature."*

Vrinda reacted first. "Oh great! Here we go again. Another arbitrary date imposed on us from on high!"

Catherine's response was slower. She flinched when she heard about the betrayal, then assumed a poker face. "So, the only way we can hit the date is by throwing away most of the work we've done? And lowering our quality standards?"

"Something's gotta give."

She looked at Phil. "Pauline really did this?"

He nodded.

Catherine's jaw tightened. "I bet she justified it by telling herself it wasn't personal—just business." She shook her head. "I do not know what else to say."

Steve gave them their marching orders. War Room for twenty-four hours. Deliver a recovery plan by four o'clock tomorrow. Four things to keep in mind:

"First, you have to deliver a complete, saleable product on this date. It's not just a software problem.

"Second, you will have to cut the product drastically. Catherine, your job is to ensure the product has the features necessary and sufficient to go live, but no more.

"Third, FPP is Wyx-Fin's number-one priority. If anything gets in your way, tell me and I'll move it.

"And finally, I hate to say this, but quality is negotiable—to a point. This baby will be born premature."

He looked at Catherine. "Come February 1st, the product will contain a large number of known and unknown defects. You'll need to make the final call about whether we go live."

Her forehead furrowed. She wasn't happy. But what choice did she have?

"Okay."

"Good," Steve said. He pushed his chair back and put on his grandest voice. "This conference room is officially a War Room."

## Ahoy, Me Mateys

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve comes home to his fairy-tale gatehouse and surprises his daughters. A moment of warmth amid the crisis—"Ahoy, me mateys!"*

That evening, Steve came home to his fairy-tale gatehouse—a two-hundred-year-old stone building built into the defensive walls of a country estate, complete with vines creeping up the walls and round turrets. A couple of times each day, tourists would stop to take photographs. From the inside, it looked like any modern small house, though the doors were built for a time when people were considerably shorter.

He snuck through the front door to surprise the kids. He heard Scooby-Doo playing in the den. Dropped his bag, slipped off his shoes, tiptoed down the hall.

He pushed the door open. "Ahoy, me mateys!"

"Dad!" They rushed him, and moments later he was covered in hugs and they were covered in kisses.

"Did you bring us any presents? Did you? Did you?"

He sat the girls down and dished out the parcels. They were shiny, tacky little things—the gifts, not the girls—but they were just the sort of thing his two little girls loved.

It felt good to be properly home.

## Sticky-Note Triage

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *The team presents their War Room plan: a skeletal product with features force-ranked on sticky notes. Shockingly, they've descoped the web app entirely. Gregor announces compulsory overtime and cancelled holidays.*

The next afternoon, Steve returned to the War Room. The walls were covered with flip chart paper and Post-it notes, the table with printouts and coffee cups. A stack of empty pizza boxes sat at the back of the room. If work had an odor, then the room smelled of work.

Gregor had a plan. "It's aggressive but, I think, workable."

They'd used a sticky-note triage system, force-ranking every feature against a pivot. More valuable features went left, less valuable went right. Then Catherine marked the absolute bare minimum with an extra-large pink sticky note.

Steve scanned the wall. The product was skeletal. Then a horrible thought occurred to him. He looked around for another bunch of stickies. There wasn't one.

"There's no web work here."

Gregor nodded, the corners of his mouth turning down.

"You've descoped the web app?"

Another nod.

"Seriously? We're launching without a web app? People will laugh."

Catherine grimaced. "Yes, we can. We will look lame, but most sales will come from our branches and call center."

Steve closed his eyes and took a calming breath. "I'm so sorry, Catherine."

She shrugged. "It's not your fault, Steve. You didn't change the date. Circumstances did."

Gregor cleared his throat. "The new plan came in at six months, including two weeks at the end for launch. I'll announce compulsory paid overtime on Monday and ask everyone to voluntarily cancel any holidays they have planned for the next six months."

Vrinda snapped at him. "They'll hate you for that."

Gregor snapped back. "You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. You do the analysis; I'll do the managing."

Steve intervened. "Look. If you two kids can't play nicely together then I'll send you to your rooms."

## Ron's Three Lists

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve meets Ron McKnight, the grumpy old-timer who runs support and maintenance with a simple three-list system. Ron agrees to bump non-urgent work to make room for FPP bug fixes.*

Steve also met with Ron McKnight, his support and maintenance manager. Ron was a grey-haired, Wyx-Fin old-timer, a curmudgeonly mix of gruff, grumpy, dour, and a few of the other lesser-known Disney dwarfs. He'd worked within Wyx-Fin's software department forever and still rolled up his sleeves whenever they had particularly ugly technical problems.

Ron operated with a simple three-list system. List #1 was a long list of requests not yet started. List #2 held the requests currently being worked on—it was always a thin list. And List #3 was an ever-growing list of finished work.

Steve asked him to clear space in the schedule for FPP bug fixing.

Ron pulled out his battered ring-binder, flipped through a few pages, and said he could bump the non-urgent work to next year. "They're my customers. They understand. They'll happily take what they can get, because none of them want to get on my bad side."

Ron was a grumpy old fella, Steve thought, but he was also flexible in a crisis.

## That Man Is an Arse

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Vrinda tells Steve that Gregor has been "lying" about project health—then Steve reveals they all knew April was unrealistic. She asks: "Surely there are better ways to motivate us lazy workers?"*

On the walk to his office, Steve asked Vrinda what was wrong.

"That man is an arse. None of us like working for him. He doesn't listen. He doesn't trust any of us and frankly, we do not trust him."

Then she said something that made Steve stop.

"For months, he's been lying about the health of the project."

"Lying?"

"He's painted a rosy picture to you and the steering group, but we all knew we'd never be live in April."

Steve looked directly in her eyes. "Gregor didn't lie to me or to our steering group. April was always an aggressive date."

She blinked. "You *knew* we'd run late?"

"Of course. And so did everyone on the steering group."

She looked at him as if he'd just told her the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny were the same person. (They're not.)

"So why'd Gregor lie to us? Just to keep the pressure on? Crack the whip to keep us lazy workers from slacking off?"

Steve felt himself getting angry. "Look, we wanted to ship in April, but we knew that date was aggressive. We kept the pressure on because if we didn't, we'd have no chance of delivering early."

She scrunched up her lips, thinking. "Did you ever consider that, given no one believed the date was feasible, perhaps some folks slowed down? No point flogging a dead horse. Especially when everyone thinks the jockey is a jerk. Who works hard for a jerk?"

Steve shrugged.

She shook her head. "Surely there are better ways to motivate us lazy workers?"

Instead of answering, Steve asked her a question. "Look, what would have happened to scope if the date had been, say, eight months later? December next year rather than April? Would the scope have been bigger or smaller?"

She looked up, thinking. "Bigger, of course. Catherine cut a lot of features to fit into April."

"And how about change requests? With more time up our sleeves, would we have more or less change?"

"More, obviously."

She screwed up her nose, as if she smelled something bad but couldn't quite tell where it was coming from. Or maybe she could.

Steve said, "You know this. The scope of the project always expands until it's too big to fit in the time available to deliver it. If we didn't put aggressive deadlines in place, we'd never ship anything."

"I suppose."

They walked the rest of the way in silence. At the building entrance, Steve said, "Look, I know you desperately want FPP to succeed. So do I. So does Gregor. But he has an incredibly difficult job juggling a lot of question marks and balancing a load of conflicting needs. I don't think he's the ogre you think he is."

She shook her head. "I never said he's an ogre. I said he's an arse, and I implied this project is going to crash and burn."

## You Look Like a Dork

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve finally meets Craig Lally for brunch. Craig takes him to meet Cheryl in the cafeteria kitchen, but Steve is distracted, checking his phone. Cheryl notices—"Looks like we've got another skeptic here."*

A few days later, Steve finally caved to Norbert's nagging and met Craig Lally for brunch.

Craig was late-fifties, tieless, and looked like a man who climbed mountains for pleasure and drove there in a twenty-year-old Volvo he maintained himself. He led Steve down to the cafeteria kitchen to meet Cheryl, a thin, short, middle-aged woman who'd worked there for twenty-eight years.

"Craig says you've got yourself in a bit of a mess and you need old Cheryl to show you how to sort it out?" she said.

Steve felt his face redden. "Something like that."

"Good. First, can you take off your tie, please?"

"Is it a safety hazard?"

"No, it's because you look like a dork."

She said it in such a nice way that Steve did as he was told.

Cheryl started explaining how they'd transformed the cafeteria—something about dog food and French fries. But Steve kept glancing at his watch and checking his phone. He had twenty-one new emails and three missed calls. He wasn't sure what a cafeteria's turnaround story had to do with his impossible software deadline.

Cheryl noticed. Her smile dropped into a deep frown. "Looks like we've got another skeptic here."

Steve apologized and said he had to go. Cheryl made a face, as if she'd smelled something bad. "We'll see," she said, and walked off without saying goodbye.

Craig sighed. "Let's talk when you're ready to listen."

Steve left, feeling slightly guilty but mostly relieved. The last thing he needed was manufacturing wisdom from people who'd lost their jobs to outsourcing.

## The Mutiny

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *The staff walks out to the pub. Steve finds them at The Burns Unit, furious about cancelled holidays. Vrinda negotiates: they'll go back to work, but no compulsory overtime—and they'll slash features further.*

A week later—mid-August now—it got worse.

Eleanor stormed onto the sixth floor at precisely 2:22 in the afternoon. "Where the hell is your staff? The FPP area is deserted!"

A contractor had snitched. The permanent staff was at the pub. The Burns Unit—officially The Robbie Burns, named after Scotland's great poet, but nicknamed after the hospital next door.

Steve found about forty of his people sitting in the far corner. ABBA's "Dancing Queen" played over the sound system. Most looked like they were drinking freshly-squeezed lemon juice. Phil and Vrinda were there. So was Declan McGuiness, the employee rep.

Steve met his friends by the dart board. It had three darts sticking out of the bullseye at unnatural angles, like someone had pushed them there rather than thrown them.

Vrinda spoke quietly, which meant she was angry. "Gregor cancelled everyone's holidays—holidays we'd already rescheduled to suit the project's previous schedule. Then he told a few of us to pull up our socks and work more overtime. I already take work home. I have children. He can shove it."

Phil said, "Steve, we're not out to screw you."

"I know that. But if not me, then who are you trying to screw?"

They said nothing. They all knew Gregor was their bad guy. But didn't they realize that by screwing him, they were screwing Steve?

Phil pulled the darts from the board and stepped back to take aim. Vrinda and Steve quickly moved out of his way.

"It's the same pattern in every project," Phil said. "A desperate mad dash at the end that we—and our families—bear the brunt of." He threw his first dart; it hit the board, bounced off, and landed on the floor. As he crouched to pick it up, he said, "The bottom line is that none of us believe we'll make February 1st. And none of us believed we'd make the original date either."

Steve took a gamble. He gestured to an empty booth and asked them to sit down. Phil walked up to the dart board and stuck his remaining dart firmly in the bullseye, then slid in after Vrinda.

Steve lowered his voice and told them—in confidence—that Hal had threatened his job.

Vrinda winced. "That's not a threat. It's an ultimatum."

Her face hardened. "You need us to get back to work?"

She picked up her mug. "I'll make you a deal, Steve. I'll get this lot back to work, but there won't be any compulsory overtime. And if you want to deliver on February 1st, we're going to have to slash even more features from the product."

"You honestly think there's more room to descope?"

"There is always more room to descope. Always."

Within minutes, the team had drained their drinks and shuffled off to their desks. None made eye contact with Steve. Not even Vrinda.

Phil smirked. "How 'bout we get that pint after all?"

Steve shook his head.

Phil shrugged. "I'll call my mom tonight and ask her to pray for you."

Phil was an atheist, so he got his mom to do his praying for him.

Steve liked that about him.

## December 1st

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Declan delivers a double blow: Chaste has moved their launch to February 1st—and Hal has issued a press release announcing Wyx-Fin will launch on December 1st. Hal has declared war on Chaste.*

Outside in the sunlight, Declan caught up with Steve, sucking on an orange plastic cigar—a nicotine replacement device, apparently designed for extroverts.

They were almost at the staff entrance when Declan rushed back, panting.

"The lads just told me that Chaste announced they're launching February 1st."

"No way."

"And worse—Hal just issued a press release announcing we're launching December 1st."

December 1st. That made no sense. No one would buy the product until April when the new tax year started. And Hal had just robbed them of two more months.

There was only one explanation. Hal had declared war on Chaste.

And Steve and his team were the collateral damage.

Steve decided, there and then, to go upstairs and explain to Hal precisely what an arsehole he was.

# Part Two: Learning the Tools

## Fowl Mood

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve chickens out of confronting Hal. Instead, he tells Gregor to cancel the compulsory overtime and cancelled vacations. Gregor asks: "What would you have done differently?" Steve has no answer.*

*Late August.*

Steve was in a fowl mood when he made it back to his desk. Yes, *fowl*, not foul. Somewhere between the second and fourth floors, the rational part of his brain clicked in. He turned into a big chicken and pushed the button for the sixth floor instead of the penthouse. He'd spent almost twenty years climbing the Wyxcomb ladder, and he wasn't about to throw that all away impulsively.

Instead of giving Hal an excuse to dump him, he summoned Gregor to his office and laid down the law: no compulsory overtime, no cancelled vacations.

Gregor's response was a question.

"What would you have done differently?"

"Pardon?"

"If you were in my shoes. What would you have done differently?"

Steve took a deep breath and did the only thing he could. He apologized. Gregor was right. He had done exactly what Steve would have done in his shoes.

Gregor shrugged. He was old enough, ugly enough and grumpy enough to be thick-skinned enough to know that sometimes taking the blame was just part of his job.

Steve shook his head. "But it shouldn't be. We should be better at this."

## Start Looking for a New Job

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve calls Norbert, who delivers brutal news: he can't protect Steve if FPP fails. Norbert's advice: beg Craig Lally for help—"Maybe he can see things the rest of us can't." And start looking for a new job.*

Steve tried to call Eleanor, but she was mid-flight to Sweden with Hal.

So he called Norbert.

Norbert answered immediately and without saying hello: "Can you deliver FPP on December 1st?"

"Realistically?"

"Of course, realistically. We are not playing computer games. You do not have three lives to play with. I ask you again: Will you deliver or not?"

"No."

"That's what I thought." The phone went silent for a moment. "I don't know if I can help you. If FPP doesn't ship, then Hal is gone. It will be difficult for me to protect you under those circumstances."

He may as well have slapped Steve across the face. Norbert wasn't just his boss—he was his mentor and protector. After Fran died, it was Norbert who pulled all the bureaucratic strings and corporate levers necessary to transfer Steve from Glasgow to Watt's Bridge, nearer his home. Eleanor hadn't wanted him—she wanted someone with smaller ambitions—but Norbert had insisted. In Wyxcomb, he said, we looked after our own.

His words hurt. Norbert knew the job market in Watt's Bridge for people like Steve was limited. He knew Steve's family situation. He knew that relocating his kids and his mother was damned near out of the question.

Steve let his breath out. "I need your help, Norbert."

He said nothing.

"What should I do?"

"Talk to your local Quality guy, Lally. Tell me how that went."

Steve chose his words carefully. "He couldn't help me with FPP. That was, and still is, my priority. He wanted to help me prevent my next FPP."

"When I pressed him, he said he was sure he could help you, but that you'd have to ask for help if you wanted it."

"Oh."

"My advice is for you to ask for his help. Beg if you have to, but get his help."

"But why him?"

"Because frankly, I don't know anyone else who wouldn't do precisely what you've already done. I am clutching at straws here. Maybe he can see things the rest of us can't."

"But what if he can't help me?"

"Then you're no worse off." Norbert was silent for a moment. "Maybe you should start looking for a new job, Steve. Leave under your own terms. You have a few months before things come to a head."

Then he hung up.

## Ten Minutes

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve swallows his pride and calls Craig, who reluctantly agrees to give him ten minutes. Steve spends eight of them explaining his crisis. Craig promises to help—a noose around one's neck focuses the mind.*

Five very long minutes later, Steve forced a smile on his face and dialed Craig Lally. It was 3:56 p.m.

Craig answered, then paused. "I didn't expect to hear from you again."

Steve apologized for how their earlier meeting had ended, then asked if Craig could spare him thirty minutes.

"Thirty minutes? I don't have thirty minutes to spare."

"Fifteen minutes, then?"

"I'm afraid I am very busy just now."

Steve steeled his jaw. "I'm desperate. I swear I wouldn't ask otherwise."

Another pause. "Yes, okay. I'll give you ten minutes, but no more."

Steve spent the first eight of his ten minutes explaining why he was desperate. Craig summed it up matter-of-factly.

"So, your concern is this: Hal Gibbet, a man not known for taking prisoners, expects you to deliver FPP by December 1st, but you don't know how long it will take to build the remaining features, then test and rework them; therefore you don't know if you can keep your promise. Is that it?"

"Yes."

"Let's use that pressure to our advantage. A noose around one's neck, they say, is very good at focusing one's thoughts."

Steve didn't laugh. It was *his* neck Craig was talking about.

Craig told Steve to hold. Steve heard muffled conversation in the background. A few minutes later, Craig called back.

"I've just spoken with Norbert. I've cleared my diary for the afternoon. I'll meet you downstairs, in the cafeteria, in twenty minutes. Bring your FPP folder with you."

## Don't Think About Small Batches

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Craig gives Steve one strange instruction: "Do not think about small batches." Steve has no idea what he's talking about.*

When they sat down, Craig had one rule.

"Do not think about small batches. Okay?"

"Small what?"

"Batches. Don't think about them."

Steve had no idea what he was talking about.

## The Dog Food Problem

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Cheryl explains how the cafeteria was about to be outsourced—the food was barely fit for a dog. Craig forced them to eat their own cooking, and within two weeks they'd transformed the quality.*

Craig took Steve back into the cafeteria kitchen to meet Cheryl—the thin, short, middle-aged woman who'd worked there for twenty-eight years.

Cheryl's eyes narrowed when she saw Steve. "You again?"

He'd walked out on her the week before, checking his phone while she was trying to help him. This time, he apologized. Properly.

"I'm sorry how our last meeting ended."

She pursed her lips, studying his face. She must have decided he meant it. "You want to hear about our French Fry Revelation?"

"I do."

She led them through to her little office where the three of them sat.

"First, some context. Three years ago, this cafeteria was about to be outsourced. The food was horrible—barely fit for human consumption. You wouldn't feed it to a dog. Well, not a posh dog; a stray would eat it if there were no alternatives. We called this our Dog Food Problem.

"That's when Craig turned up and forced us to eat our own dog food. Literally. He insisted we eat the same food we served our customers. And once we started tasting our own cooking?" She smiled. "We started caring about it. We tested the food before we served it. Fixed things with a little salt or pepper. Within two weeks, we'd transformed the quality. That won us loads more customers. We made loads more money. We saved our jobs."

Steve nodded. She was clearly proud of the achievement.

"Here's the thing though. Soup is cheap, easy to cook and hard to screw up. If the stock and the other ingredients are good, then the soup's good. But, crazy as this sounds, our soup often tasted horrible. You want to know why?"

"Of course."

"No one ever tasted it before serving it."

"Pardon?"

"No one ever tasted it before serving it. We cooked food from scratch, following supposedly 'foolproof' recipes from Head Office. We followed the recipes to the letter, but no one tested them to see how they tasted."

Steve was stunned.

"Well, I'm embarrassed to admit it now, but—frankly—we didn't care. None of us ate the food we sold and none of us particularly cared about the food we sold. We worked our hours, what more could you ask from us?"

"What changed?"

"By threatening to outsource our jobs, our bosses gave us a reason to worry. By insisting we eat our own food, Craig gave us a reason to care."

That was the Dog Food Problem—eat what you serve. Taste the software.

"But that was only the first step," Cheryl said.

## The French Fry Revelation

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Cheryl reveals the secret of never running out of chips: cook small batches and replenish on demand. By the end of the first month, they were serving 30% more customers. Revenue up 40%. Jobs saved.*

Cheryl led them to the deep fryers.

"Tell me. What would happen if we ever ran out of chips?"

"You'd all be strung up outside the castle gates."

She nodded. "Would that happen if we ran out of salad, or soup, or two-week-old cabbage?"

"Not much. Maybe people would eat chips instead."

"Unspoken rule Number One around here is: Don't run out of chips. Rule Two is: Don't serve cold chips. Understand?"

Steve smiled. "Some things are sacred."

"Our French Fry Revelation happened when Craig asked me why we never ran out of chips and yet, at the same time, we rarely threw out chips because of cooking too many. You know what I said to him?"

"No idea."

"It's obvious, Steve. Our serving staff keeps an eye on how many chips they've got out front, and when it gets too low, they shout out and we cook more. Craig says we *replenish on demand*." She glanced at Craig. "Has he asked you not to think about small batches yet?"

Steve looked at Craig, but he was eagerly reading a safety instruction notice stuck beside the fryers. "He has."

"He did the same to me. It was like I was an oyster and he'd planted a bit of grit inside my shell, hoping I'd turn it into a pearl."

Cheryl continued. "Nowadays, we prep most of the vegetables before the lunch rush. We cook our first small batch just before lunch, and during the service our servers keep an eye on what's selling. They shout out to the cooks when we need to put on the next batch."

"What happens if you're really busy? Don't you run the risk of not keeping up?"

"That could happen, but it doesn't. Can you figure out why?"

Steve put his hand to his chin. "Do you cook in larger batches, based on demand?"

"Bingo!" she said. "Give the man a cigar!"

Strange. That was the second time someone had offered him a cigar that day.

"The first day was nuts," Cheryl said. "The second day was a little less nuts. And things just kept getting less nuts every day."

Steve said, "Is that why you have a sign out front that says some food may contain nuts?"

She ignored him.

By the end of the first month, they were serving thirty percent more customers, revenue was up by forty percent, and since most of their costs were fixed, they were suddenly turning a healthy profit.

They got to keep their jobs.

Steve said, "So cooking small batches not only improved your product quality, it also solved your forecasting problem. Rather than cooking in big batches way in advance, you cook smaller batches, which lets you adapt according to what people are buying."

"Exactly!" said Cheryl.

It all made perfect sense. To them. But Steve had no idea how it applied to his situation. He didn't know what small batches meant in a software context. And he suspected neither did Craig. He may hope the principles Cheryl's team used also applied to software development, but Steve was certainly a guinea pig.

For the next few hours, he decided he would cross his fingers and hope Craig was right. He had nothing left to lose.

Craig thanked Cheryl and they made their way back to their seats out front.

## Requirements Are Really Forecasts

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Craig challenges Steve's assumptions: "requirements" are really just forecasts—predictions that may be wrong. He sketches a 2x2 grid showing most people think you choose between quality and speed—but there's a top-right corner.*

Craig picked up the 312-page FPP requirements folder and weighed it in his hands.

"These things you call *requirements*—I don't think that word means what you think it means."

"Pardon?"

"If they were genuinely required, then that implies they were mandatory. And if they were mandatory, then how could your customers descope them? How could they possibly be required one minute, then not required the next?"

Steve's face felt hot.

"Here's how I see it, Steve. When your team wrote this document, it was in fact a forecast, nothing more than a prediction or an educated guess."

"We put a lot of effort into getting that right. We did market research, surveys, studied goat entrails and tea leaves and consulted an oracle..."

Craig smiled. "But it wasn't right, was it? How many times have you descoped requirements?"

"Twice."

Craig nodded. "Forecasts, by definition, will sometimes be right and will sometimes be wrong; otherwise we'd call them facts. Here's the lesson: You can blame yourselves when your forecasted requirements are wrong, or you can change the way you work so it matters less."

Craig grabbed a napkin and sketched a simple grid—two axes, four boxes.

"Everyone thinks they're choosing between these two," he said, pointing to the top-left and bottom-right corners.

|            | **Slow** | **Fast** |
|------------|:--------:|:--------:|
| **High Quality** | ✓ Traditional | |
| **Low Quality** | | ✓ Crisis Mode |

"High quality but slow. Or fast but shoddy. That's the trade-off everyone believes in. That's the assumption driving your December 1st panic."

Steve nodded. That was exactly what he'd told his team: quality is negotiable, this baby will be born premature.

Craig tapped the empty top-right corner. "But what if you could hit this one instead?"

|            | **Slow** | **Fast** |
|------------|:--------:|:--------:|
| **High Quality** | Traditional | **???** |
| **Low Quality** | | Crisis Mode |

"High quality *and* fast?"

"Quality, done right, doesn't slow you down. It speeds you up. All that rework you do at the end of every project? That's the cost of building quality in *late*. Build it in early, in small batches, and you go faster."

Steve stared at the napkin. It was such a simple diagram. And yet everything he'd been taught about software development said the top-right corner was impossible.

He thought of the dart board in the pub that afternoon. Three darts in the bullseye, each at an unnatural angle—pushed there rather than thrown. That's what the top-right corner felt like. A bullseye you couldn't actually hit. You could cheat your way there, or pretend you'd hit it, but you couldn't really throw the dart and land it cleanly.

Could you?

Craig handed him a homework assignment: Think about how Cheryl's lessons might apply to software. Think about small batches. And call Catherine to ask her a few questions.

Then Craig left for his son's wedding rehearsal, promising to be back in a few days.

Steve checked his phone. He had a voicemail from Eleanor which more or less told him she'd spoken to Norbert, and that he was to work with Craig or pack his bags. Nice.

## Homework at the Kitchen Sink

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve does the dishes and thinks about Cheryl's lessons. He realizes his requirements document is really just a forecast—and they've already thrown away work they'd built, just like Cheryl threw away unsold food.*

That evening, Steve did the dishes—he and his mum had a deal where she cooked and he cleaned. As he scrubbed away, his mind played back the day. The mutiny. The cafeteria. The very real possibility he wouldn't have a job in a few months.

Not your typical day at the office.

He'd also been assigned homework—something that hadn't happened in nearly twenty years. Best get on with that.

He thought about Cheryl's team. They'd wasted food because they cooked it too far in advance in big batches. They'd guessed wrong about what people wanted. Overproduction—wasted effort. Underproduction—lost sales.

FPP had exactly the same problem, but on a much larger scale.

His requirements document was really just a forecast. A prediction. A guess. And they'd already had to descope twice—throwing away work they'd already built, just like Cheryl had thrown away unsold food.

Like most things in the kitchen, the dish rack was small, and it was soon full. Steve grabbed a fresh dish towel, quickly did the drying, then started washing again.

He thought about the four payment methods in FPP. One was indisputably required—the standard UK bank transfer. No one would buy the product without it. That was like French fries in Cheryl's cafeteria.

But what about the other three? Check payments, instant transfers, overseas telegraphic transfers. They'd all been descoped in the War Room. Were they really *requirements* if Catherine could push them aside when push came to shove?

It didn't make sense to call them *optional requirements*. That was an oxymoron, wasn't it? He decided to call them *features* instead. Some features were required. Some were optional. And some—like the overseas transfer that might appeal to customers retiring to Spain—were really just forecasts. Guesses about what customers might want.

Steve stopped and smiled to himself. He felt like he'd just realized what he'd subconsciously known all along.

He gave the pan an angry scrub. It annoyed him that customers always claimed every feature was required, when logic said they weren't. Why did they hoard?

The obvious answer: because they didn't trust that they'd ever get a phase two. If they didn't include everything now, and realized later they needed it, the only way to get it was to submit a change request and beg. Odds of approval? Low. So they threw everything in they could think of, claimed it was all top priority, and the project got bloated and late.

Steve spoke aloud to the dishes.

"There is a natural priority within our customers' requirements. They only say everything is top priority because they feel compelled to hoard."

He grabbed another pot from the stove and dunked it in the soapy water. His mum had used it for tomorrow's porridge, and even though she'd soaked it, the inside was thick with stuck-on oats. Ick.

"There must be a way to get our customers to prioritize. If I can do that, then I can break the vicious circle."

But how? In the cafeteria, they prioritized by cooking more of what customers were actually buying. Steve couldn't just cook up a batch of features cheaply and make more if they sold well. Software didn't work that way.

He scrubbed at the porridge pot, thinking.

## Small Batches Click

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve finds Ashley's half-eaten cereal—she always takes more than she needs. The insight clicks: small batches are simply small projects delivering the most important features first. Disappointingly dull, but right.*

He went to the lounge looking for stray dishes and found two bowls the kids had left. One was empty, the other half-full of soggy cornflakes. That would be his little Ashley—she always took more cereal than she needed, then they ended up wasting it. He'd asked her, many times, to just take a small bowl's worth then get more if she was still hungry.

But she was still young.

He took the bowls back to the kitchen and kept thinking.

He'd told Craig that if only customers prioritized their features at the start of each project, they could build a smallish version of the solution—just big enough to deliver comfortably before the deadline. Then, if they had time and budget left over, they could add the next highest features.

That sounded like cooking up a medium-sized batch followed by smaller ones. Craig had refused to tell him what small batches looked like in software. He said Steve would figure it out.

Could it be something as simple as breaking a medium-sized project down into a bunch of smaller projects?

He thought it could.

Was that all there was to it?

He thought a moment, and decided it was. A small batch was a small project in which they delivered a small selection of features—not just any small selection, but a small selection of the *most important* features.

How disappointingly dull. He'd expected thunderclaps and awe, or maybe a Eureka Moment where he jumped out of his office and ran naked down the street. But there was none of that. Did Cheryl feel similarly underwhelmed when she figured out she shouldn't cook a huge pot of cabbage, but several smaller ones? Probably.

Still, it felt right and it felt good. Steve smiled and said aloud, "Nice."

Small batches were small projects. But that still didn't help him with the prioritization problem.

Or did it?

They couldn't get their customers to prioritize adequately when they did big projects. Would they behave differently if, instead of asking them to lock in twelve months of work, they asked them to set in stone just the first month? What if they told Catherine the analysts, designers, developers and testers were ready to start, and if she didn't tell them what to work on, they'd choose on her behalf and start spending her budget—probably picking the most technically interesting features unless she told them otherwise?

Yes. Small batches would force their customers to prioritize.

In fact, if they could guarantee that each project had a genuine phase two—one that was used to *enhance* rather than just fix bugs—customers would stop hoarding. They'd trust that they could get features later.

But of course, what customer in their right mind would believe that guarantee? They'd been burned too many times.

Steve wiped down the benches and gave the kitchen floor a quick sweep.

Craig was right; small batches were key. But a key is useless without someone to put it in the lock, turn it, and then yank the door open.

# Part Three: The Inverted Pyramid

## The Heart Attack Survivor

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *FPP is in a state of emergency—Steve's equivalent of a heart attack. He needs to make the most of that crisis to drive change.*

*Early September.*

Do you know any ex-smokers who only found the impetus to give up after surviving their first heart attack?

Steve knew two.

FPP was in a state of emergency—his equivalent of a heart attack survivor—and he had to make the most of that.

## Younger Men, With Stamina

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve calls Catherine and realizes she could have told them the minimum viable product from day one. He thinks about Ron's three-list system, then hunts for a book in his attic—and discovers the inverted pyramid.*

That evening, Steve called Catherine—his customer rep, the one with the wild red hair who'd taken Pauline's betrayal so personally. He needed to understand something.

"Could you have told us what FPP's minimum viable solution was—the bare bones from the War Room—way back at the start of the project?"

She didn't even pause. "Of course."

"Can you roll forward to December, after FPP is live? Can you tell me what we should be working on next?"

"Sure. My team's put together a spreadsheet of post-implementation work." She rattled off half a dozen features. "I can tell you exactly what they are if you give me a minute."

While Catherine pulled up the spreadsheet, Steve thought about how he explained complicated slideshows—revealing concepts bit by bit, building ideas over time, taking care not to overwhelm his audience.

And then he thought about Ron McKnight.

Ron's support and maintenance team built up their software the same way: they started with an existing system and added to it bit by bit, one change request at a time. That's why Ron had been so flexible when Steve asked him to clear space for FPP. Ron kept his List #2—the work currently in progress—nice and short. He never made commitments about List #1 until he reasonably could. His customers knew that and accepted it.

Limiting the number of requests on List #2 limited his work in process. Which was very much like working in small batches.

Catherine continued talking through her prioritized features, and Steve listened as she described how the system would grow, feature upon feature upon feature.

And then the most important piece of the puzzle revealed itself.

A newspaper sat folded on the couch across the room, front page headline visible above the fold. Something about factory closures. Steve didn't need to read the article to know what it said—that was the clever thing about how reporters wrote. They put the most important stuff at the top, then the next most important, then the next. It gave them and their editors huge flexibility.

He thanked Catherine and hung up. Then he went to his bookcase, looking for a book about marketing he'd read years ago. It had a story in it about the telegraph system.

His mum arrived with a plate of cheese and nuts, in case he was still hungry.

"What are you looking for?"

"A book."

"What book?"

"A book about marketing and communications. It's important."

He checked the first shelf. Not there.

"Some cheese?"

"Maybe in a few minutes." He checked the second shelf.

"Some nuts, then?"

"Maybe later." Third shelf. Plenty of books, but not the one he wanted.

"I may take a lover. Perhaps two," Mum said.

"Uh-hum."

"Younger men, with stamina."

Steve stopped. Gave her his full attention. "What?"

She smiled. She knew she had him. "What's the book called?"

"It's called *Made to Stick*. It's got a story in it about the telegraph system."

"Is it in the attic?"

He dashed up the stairs to the landing, reached up and turned the attic trapdoor latch with his fingertips, and carefully let the door drop open.

Mum followed him up. "Is something wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong. Trust me. Everything is about to fall into place."

She frowned, not understanding.

Steve spoke with his hands emphasizing the important bits. "Look, Ron's team works on lots of little projects. He ships new software several times each month. He's got three lists—bug fixes, small enhancements, medium enhancements—and they deliver a constant stream of completed requests. Every few days, *bam!* Another one shipped. Start the next one. Then a few days later—*bam!*—another one."

He could see she wasn't keeping up, but he kept going anyway. He needed to hear the words spoken aloud to sanity-check them.

"When the FPP thing happened, Ron said he could change his release dates just like that, without any hassle. His team is so much more nimble than my project teams. And why? Because his workload is made up of loads of small requests. His team completes each one, tests the arse off it, makes sure they haven't broken anything, and releases it. Sometimes one at a time, sometimes batched up—it all depends on what makes sense. But they never do big batches. Never."

He stopped. "You see?"

She said, "I don't like it when you say the word arse, Steven."

Well, at least she was listening. He apologized, then stood on tiptoes and reached for the attic ladder.

"Be careful. You'll wake the kids."

He nodded and carefully pulled the ladder down to its full height. It clicked into place.

"But with FPP, it's a big project, right? It's not made up of loads of little requests. At least, that's what we thought. We thought we couldn't do what Ron does. That's what we thought. But we can. At least I think we can."

"I haven't got a clue what you're talking about. Just don't wake the kids. They'll be grumpy in the morning."

Steve climbed into the attic, turned on the light, picked his way through old PCs and vacuum-packed baby babies until he found the boxes of old books. He rooted around until he found what he was looking for.

When he made his way back down the ladder, Mum was still there watching. He flipped through the pages and almost immediately found what he wanted.

That was when Steve had what he would later call his Egyptian Revelation.

He turned the page toward her and smiled. "There it is: the inverted pyramid."

## Transaction Complete

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *The team watches as Catherine, wearing a paper "CSR" hat, keys in the first customer application through FPP. A lot is riding on this thin slice of software working properly.*

Three weeks later, the team sat squished around the conference room table. Another dozen stood against the walls. The room looked more lived in now—walls covered in printouts, sticky notes, and drawings. A large fluorescent pink, green and white striped toy snake, which Vrinda had named Fippy, had mysteriously threaded his way across the top of the projection screen.

Catherine wore a paper hat with "CSR" written on it in thick black pen. Customer Service Representative. She was pretending to be one—keying in the first customer application through the software. The screen showed an hourglass.

They watched and waited.

A lot was riding on this thin slice of FPP working properly.

## We Cannot Deliver on December 1st

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve tells the team the truth: December is impossible. He introduces the inverted pyramid—deliver the most important features first, each chunk "good enough to ship." Catherine insists on being involved in prioritization.*

Three weeks earlier, Steve had assembled the leadership team and told them the truth.

"We cannot deliver FPP on December 1st."

Silence. Tim finally answered. "February was a stretch. December is impossible."

Vrinda said, "We are on a Death March."

Catherine looked at Steve expectantly. "But you're working on a plan, right?"

"I've been working with Craig Lally over the last few weeks, and we've identified a tweak to our existing test processes that will increase our odds of succeeding."

"*Increase* our odds?"

"Honestly, I know this will make things better, but I don't know if we'll make the date."

He walked to the wall and picked six sticky notes—Catherine's highest priority features—and handed them to Gregor. "Hypothetically, how long would it take to deliver a product containing only those six features?"

Gregor studied them, screwed up his face, then shook his head. "I don't really know. We'd need to plan in more detail. Maybe two weeks if we got lucky. Six or seven if we don't."

Steve took all but one sticky note back. "How long for just that one?"

"Look, Steve, this is unfair. There's too much uncertainty."

"But you'd be able to deliver it by December 1st?"

"Almost certainly."

"You mean definitely?"

"Well, almost definitely then."

Catherine exploded. "Why the hell did you commit to deliver the entire project on February 1st if you can't even tell me how long it takes to deliver one little feature?" She spun to face Steve. "I thought you guys were supposed to be professionals."

"Professionals!" Gregor blurted. "You guys upstairs wouldn't even know about Chaste's ambush if it weren't for Phil. How do *you* have the nerve to call *yourselves* professionals?"

"Oh right, blame us for this mess. You made a promise which we took in good faith. You're screwing around with my career here—not to mention Wyx-Fin's reputation and profitability."

Steve intervened. "I made that promise, not Gregor. And I admit I've had my fingers crossed since, hoping I'd make good on it. We haven't. I'm sorry."

"Well, I'm sorry too, Steven, but if you can't even commit to delivering that one feature, then I've got to recommend we scrap the entire frigging project." She sat back, folded her arms, and muttered something Steve's mum wouldn't have approved of.

To Steve's surprise, Vrinda jumped to Gregor's defense. "He didn't say he couldn't deliver that feature. He said he couldn't promise with certainty. Earthquakes, fires, floods—they're very unlikely to happen."

Phil stuck his hand up. "Realistically, it's more likely the messaging technology will blow up in our face."

The whole room turned to stare at him.

"Hey, it's in your risk register. It looked okay during proof-of-concept, but it's never been properly tested. We're guinea pigs."

Catherine folded her arms. "So we won't know if it's an issue until we start testing?"

Tim stepped in. "The project is loaded with question marks. Things we can't know until we test. The messaging system is top of our list."

Catherine unfolded her arms. "That's why we test, right?"

"Of course."

"Then you need to start testing it today."

Steve nodded. "You're right. We must start testing as soon as possible. But we need to start testing more than just the messaging system. And we can't wait until the testing phase starts."

Phil stood, collected the six sticky notes, and stuck them back on the wall. He stared for a minute, then picked up one.

"We have to test this eventually. And let's be honest, rework it—there's no way it works right the first time. Problem is, the testing phase doesn't start for weeks." He took a deep breath. "The good news is we *can* pull some testing forward and start now. If it uncovers bad news, then good! We've found it early, when there's still time to fix it."

Gregor joined Phil at the wall. He peeled off another sticky. "We should do the same with this one. Nasty mainframe changes that haven't been tested."

Soon everyone was at the wall, and after fifteen minutes they'd agreed to spend the next week or so testing and reworking three of the riskier high-value features.

The team rejoined at the table.

"We'll learn a lot about the quality of our earlier work," Catherine said.

Gregor added, "And in a week or so, we'll have a far better idea whether we can hit December 1st."

Steve nodded. "Agreed. We start the testing phase today, with those features as our first small batch. But there's more to it than that.

"Way back in the nineteenth century, journalists invented a new way of writing articles. It's called the inverted pyramid. It let reporters keep their commitments under conditions of high uncertainty.

"Imagine you're a reporter in the Wild West and you've got a hot news story to send to your editor in New York. Before the telegraph, you'd write your story and send it by stagecoach—introduction, middle, conclusion. *It was a sunny morning as the president ate breakfast. He went about his day, ending up at a theater where he was shot. He was rushed to a doctor, and then he died.*

"But then the telegraph arrived. Reporters could transmit in hours rather than weeks. The problem was, the telegraph was unreliable. A twenty-word telegram made it through fine, but three hundred-word articles often got cut off mid-transmission."

"If the conclusion—that the president died—is missing, the story loses its point," Catherine said. "The story is only useful if transmitted in its entirety."

Steve nodded. "Can you see the connection to how FPP is structured?"

"Our product can't ship—which is when it becomes valuable—until all the testing is done. Is that what you mean?"

"Exactly. The reporters solved their problem by inverting their articles. Flipping them so the most newsworthy paragraph was at the top, then the next most important, and so on. Even if transmission was interrupted halfway through, the editor still had a useful article."

Gregor tilted his head. "Very clever."

Steve let that sink in. "I want us to invert FPP. Deliver the most important paragraph first, then the next most important, and so on until we hit December 1st. Each paragraph—each small batch—must be good enough to ship."

"*Good enough to ship?*"

"Good enough to ship. We won't ship until December 1st, but I want each small chunk fully tested, fully reworked, good enough quality that we *could* ship it. Each chunk complete in itself."

Catherine didn't look happy. "So you're reneging on your War Room promise. Is this just another way of descoping?"

"Yes. It's a severe descoping *now* rather than later. By the time we leave this room, I hope to have pared the project back to just those three stickies. They'll be our first chunk of good-enough-to-ship software. We test and rework until it's ready, then start the next chunk."

"But you can't tell me exactly what I'll get on December 1st?"

"Nope. But if we don't change, it's probable you'll get nothing."

Her eyebrows furrowed. "Are you asking me for permission, Steve, or telling me this is how it's going to be?"

Steve made eye contact with everyone around the table. "I'm saying this is how it has to be."

"In that case," Catherine said, "we'd better decide what goes in this chunk, and then the following ones."

Gregor said, "Phil, Tim and I can do that."

Catherine shook her head. "No. I need to be involved."

"Why?"

"I'm not getting every feature on the wall, right?"

Steve said, "It seems unlikely."

"In that case, I must prioritize to ensure we get the best possible product within the time available."

Gregor said, "You've already prioritized. I thought we'd tackle them in order."

She shook her head and went to the wall. She grabbed one of the top three high-risk features—the one needing mainframe work—and stuck it on the far right. "This is high risk, but lower value than other features. I'd rather increase my odds of having the others and find a manual workaround for this one."

She stepped back, then started rearranging stickies. She crumpled one up and replaced it with three from different parts of the wall.

"We've still got budget until April 1st, right?"

"At least."

"So we can keep working this way after we go live in December?"

Steve hadn't thought that far ahead. "It's your budget."

"In that case"—she moved another bunch of stickies to the right—"I don't need these until shortly after we go live."

The re-planning took another thirty minutes, and Steve sat back and watched as the team restructured the wall. His only contribution was to ask *That would be good enough to ship, right?* every so often.

In the end, they settled on a tiny chunk—the tip of the iceberg—that would take between one and two weeks to finalize, depending on what ugly issues they uncovered.

## It Worked

> *Catherine clicks the Finish button. The hourglass spins. Then: "Transaction complete." It worked.*

Three weeks later—Phil's concerns about the messaging system having come true—they finally delivered their first chunk.

Catherine clicked the *Finish* button. The cursor turned into an hourglass.

They watched and waited.

Then the confirmation dialog appeared.

Transaction complete.

It worked.

# Part Four: Transformation Under Fire

## The Rhythm

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *The team falls into a rhythm: build, test, fix, ship, repeat. Every few days—bam!—another chunk shipped. Exhausting, but working.*

*Early October.*

Their first chunk of good-enough-to-ship software worked. Transaction complete.

But that was just the beginning.

Over the following weeks, the team fell into a rhythm. Build a chunk. Test it. Fix it. Ship it. Start the next one. Each chunk was small enough to understand, small enough to test thoroughly, small enough to finish.

The messaging system gave them grief—Phil's concerns had been well-founded—but they worked through it, fix by fix, problem by problem. Every few days, *bam!* Another chunk shipped. Then a few days later—*bam!*—another one.

It was exhausting. But it was working.

## Don't Screw It Up

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Hal summons Steve and confronts him about changing the approach without permission. Steve holds his ground: "You gave me a deadline. You didn't tell me how to hit it." Hal nods. "Don't screw it up."*

Hal summoned Steve to the penthouse. He didn't offer him a seat.

"I hear you've changed the way you're running things."

"We have."

"And you didn't think to ask permission?"

Steve held his ground. "You gave me a deadline. You didn't tell me how to hit it."

Hal studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded, once. "Fair enough. Don't screw it up."

That was as close to encouragement as Hal ever got.

## Four Million Pounds

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Eleanor reveals the financial impact: delivering eight months early means four million pounds in unexpected revenue. Hal's happy? "What an interesting idea." Steve's played with the big boys—and got pooped on by a seagull.*

Steve met Eleanor by the sea wall, near her favorite spot overlooking the harbor. A seagull squawked above them.

He tore a crust off his baguette and threw it high in the air. The bird caught it in midair then swooped away without even saying thank you. He named it Hal the Seagull and waited for it to fly over and poop on his head.

Eleanor spoke quietly. "This may change everything. I need to tell you something, Steve. You cannot share it with anyone. Promise me?"

"I promise."

"I did not believe you would deliver FPP on time. Nor did Hal. Nor anyone in Group. So your good news, while it is good, has taken us by surprise."

"I understand." He didn't tell her he was probably more surprised than they were.

"FPP was Hal's get-out-of-jail-free card. With that card in question, we were forced to take some drastic actions. FPP may yet save us from having to follow through on them." She paused. "Of course, it might not. It all depends on how well FPP sells when we launch."

She turned to face him. "Do you understand the financial implications of delivering FPP in December?"

Steve thought a moment. "We're finishing eight months early. That saves us... two million in development costs?"

"No. We won't stop development in December—we'll keep investing in FPP, growing it. The only thing that matters is how well it sells. Try again."

He paused, not knowing where to start.

Eleanor sighed. "Let's take this slowly. Our cut-down product looks disturbingly like Chaste's, so there's no obvious reason for new customers to prefer ours. But we have a loyal customer base. I pragmatically assume it will pull in half a million a month, on average, starting in December. Now—given that's money coming in we didn't expect—what are the financial implications of delivering early?"

Steve's mouth slowly fell open as he crunched the numbers. Eight months of unexpected sales, at half a million each month...

"Four million pounds."

"Four million cash in our coffers that wouldn't have been there otherwise." She nodded. "Who'd have thought that a drunken confession from a former employee would cause us to bring something like four million into the company?"

"Hal's happy with me then?"

She chuckled. "Hal happy? What an interesting idea. As far as he's concerned, you promised February 1st, and pulling the date forward was just good management on *his* part. You're playing with the big boys and girls now, Steve. Get over it."

Then she hung up on him.

The seagull had pooped on him, after all.

## You Should Have Asked for Help Earlier

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Ron reveals that Steve's inverted pyramid is actually well-established "incremental delivery"—used successfully since the 1970s. Steve didn't invent it; he rediscovered it. "You should have asked for help earlier."*

A few weeks later, Steve stood outside Ron McKnight's office. It was 8:36 p.m.

He knocked and pushed the door open. Ron sat at his desk, typing in the dark, his face lit up in dull green by his monitor. Green meant old mainframe code. His desk was stacked high with books and papers—the company's clear-desk policy was one of many rules that didn't apply to Ron.

When Ron finally looked up, his smile dropped. "Steven."

"Nice to see you too, Ron."

"You've come about the FPP review."

"Review?"

"Eleanor and Norbert asked me to run an independent assessment of FPP's health."

Steve shrugged. Who could blame them?

Ron clicked a few times and his printer whirred. "I'll give you the three-word version: they're fine."

"That's two words."

"Technically, 'they're' is two words, Steve."

The printer ejected a single page. Steve jumped to the last paragraph, where the gotchas normally hide:

*I, the author, have only one concern: In order for incremental development to work, each increment must be good enough to ship. I have seen no proof, as of yet, that this is indeed the case on FPP. Who knows what trolls lie under the bridge until we look under said bridge?*

"Trolls?"

"Read the whole thing."

Steve's jaw dropped when he read the first paragraph:

*FPP's approach to delivering software (the so-called "inverted pyramid" approach), is merely a variation on well-established incremental delivery methods, which have been used by considerably larger software development projects for decades.*

"Incremental delivery methods?"

Ron nodded.

"But... that means my inverted pyramid approach... it already exists?"

"That should be clear, given my choice of words."

"I thought I'd invented it."

Ron laughed. "You inverted the pyramid, but you didn't invent it. You rediscovered it. And renamed it. It's just a shame you didn't think to do it at the start of FPP, rather than after you'd built all that code, but otherwise—you did well."

He pulled a thick, dusty book from under his monitor. *Software Engineering Economics* by Barry Boehm, from 1981. He flipped to page forty-one and stabbed a heading: *Incremental Development*.

Steve read: *Incremental development should develop software in increments of functional capability.*

"This has been known for decades?"

Ron nodded. "It's been successfully used on projects costing over a hundred million dollars, way back in the seventies. As well as small projects."

Steve studied Ron's whiteboard, satisfied but annoyed with himself. "I should have thought to do this earlier."

Ron shook his head solemnly. "Wrong. You should have asked for help earlier."

## I'm Not Begging for a Change

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Catherine realizes she no longer has to beg for change requests—she can simply reprioritize. "I'm not requesting a change, Steve. I am simply reprioritizing our list." The new feature will differentiate them from Chaste.*

The next morning, Catherine marched into Steve's office, Gregor a few steps behind her. Neither looked happy.

"Shoot," Steve said.

Gregor's hands flew out. "Catherine wants to—"

Catherine threw up her hand like a cop making a stop sign. "Give me a moment. You are so impatient."

She pulled out her laptop and opened Gregor's planning spreadsheet. She'd highlighted a new row at the top: *Customer Level Income*. No estimate yet.

"What's stopping me from having this feature?"

Gregor's neck turned crimson. "Due respect, Catherine, but we rejected that change request about seventeen times already."

"You did indeed. But last night, I realized I no longer have to beg for change requests." She smiled. "Instead, I simply ask you to estimate how long it will take, and then I prioritize it against everything else. So I'd like to know by lunchtime—how much effort will this take, and does it put our December date at risk?"

Steve felt his jaw tighten. It felt like she'd played them, using their inverted pyramid approach as a weapon against them. He stumbled around in his mind, looking for a reason to say no.

He couldn't find one.

Catherine summed up her argument. "I'm not requesting a change, Steve. I'm not even begging for a change. I am simply reprioritizing our list."

Her words sunk in. She was right. This wasn't a change request. It was a reprioritization.

"Can we absorb this and still deliver the bare minimum?" Steve asked Gregor.

"We can absorb this, I guess. But it means something else gets pushed out."

Catherine nodded. "I know that when you add this feature, I'll lose something from the bottom of my must-have list. But I'm willing to make that trade. Besides"—she smiled—"Pauline left before we came up with this feature. It'll differentiate us from Chaste."

## We Could Go Live Today

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Catherine is exhausted—juggling training, rollout, and development. But she says something surprising: "If we were desperate, we could go live today." Her bare minimum has shrunk again.*

A week later, Catherine met Steve in Lister Square, halfway between their offices. She looked exhausted—dark rings under her eyes, hair tied back in an efficient but unflattering ponytail.

"My get-up-and-go has not only got up and gone," she said, "it's taken my will to live with it."

She listed her problems on her fingers. "One: internal launch event on the 17th. Mark"—her boss, the one who'd championed Future Perfect from the start—"insists on a big fancy show. Two: training material for branches and call center. Three: rolling out training to all thirty-six Scottish branches in two weeks—impossible. Four: ramping up the call center—recruitment, equipment, training. Five: still steering your development team."

"Why didn't you say anything until now?"

She looked at her hands. "I've been too swamped to sit down and figure out if it was feasible." She shrugged. "I've never had a genuine phase two before."

Then she said something that surprised him.

"If we were desperate, we could go live today with what we've already got."

"How is that possible? We've already slashed the product back to bare bones."

"Last night, I took a red pen to our call center scripts and pared them back enough that we could go live today. I don't *want* to go live today—but we could if we had to."

Steve stared at her. Her bare minimum had shrunk yet again.

"I'm still learning to work this new way," she said. "But here's the thing: I need to pull half my business analysts off development work and onto rollout."

"That's worse! Our bottleneck will intensify."

"Maybe. But honestly?" She shrugged. "The development work isn't our concern right now. What matters is being ready to sell on December 1st."

She was right. The pyramid had inverted not just for software, but for the whole project.

## Walk Before You Run

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Catherine presents the incremental rollout plan: start with local branches, learn to walk before you run. Mark wraps it up: "A pig is just a pig until you put a ribbon on it—then it becomes a gift." Hal's verdict: "pig-ugly website."*

The internal launch event came two weeks before go-live—mid-November now. Mark had assembled an audience of everyone who mattered—plus Steve.

Catherine took the stage. Behind her, a slide showed a chubby toddler supporting himself against a couch.

"This is my nephew Hamish. He's about eighteen months old here, at that stage between crawling and walking. Not many weeks later, he was walking. And then running."

Words appeared under Hamish's picture:

**WALK BEFORE YOU RUN.**

"We're rolling out incrementally, starting with our local Watt's Bridge branches. They're close by, we have excellent relationships with the staff, and in return for getting a head start selling our hottest new product, they'll help shape our sales approach. Like wee Hamish, we're learning to walk so that when we need to run, in April, we can."

She clicked, and Hamish faded. He was replaced by a stock photo of a racing pit crew changing tires.

"Although our product is already live, we haven't finished developing it. We're using the staggered rollout to test with real staff and real customers. When we find something we don't like, we fix it. If it needs software changes, Steve's team is primed—like the pit crew behind me—ready to pounce on any changes and implement them immediately.

"And when is the best time to learn and adapt like this? When it's easy and cheap. When we have a dedicated IT pit crew standing by, and when we only have a few branches up and running."

Mark stepped forward. "We've got a great product, and we'll keep making it better by listening to our customers. Every new product launch is a bet. This staggered rollout loads the dice in our favor."

He grinned at the audience. "You know what I always say: a pig is just a pig until you put a ribbon on it—then it becomes a gift. We've taken what could have been a limitation and wrapped it up as an advantage."

He stared directly at Hal, challenging him to say something nice.

Moments passed.

Then Hal stood. He nodded to Mark and Catherine, then looked up and found Steve in the back row.

"Your team has done excellent work. Though, frankly"—he turned to Steve—"your website is pig-ugly. Not your finest hour, Steven."

Steve smiled. Pig-ugly was apt, and if that was the worst Hal could say, it was a victory. Four weeks earlier, they didn't even have a web app.

"Thank you, Hal. We're very proud of what we've achieved."

# Part Five: Resolution

## Your Choice

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Eleanor and Hal reveal the stakes: if FPP doesn't sell well by August, Wyx-Fin gets sold. But Norbert wants Steve for a new Group-wide role—with more travel. Steve has a choice to make.*

*November 17th.*

The internal launch event was over. The room emptied. Celebration drinks were being poured in the cafeteria next door.

Eleanor rested her hand on Steve's arm. "Wait."

Hal hopped out of his front row seat and marched up toward them. For a man his age, he was surprisingly agile. He swung into the seat beside Steve.

"That went far better than I expected."

"Gee, thanks."

Hal lowered his voice. "Norbert is telling everyone in Group you're a superhero and inverting is your secret weapon. I've asked my mother to knit you a Christmas jumper with a great big red I on the front."

Steve smiled politely. Hal had a caustic way of saying thank you. "And you, Hal? What do you think?"

His eyes narrowed. "You got lucky. Lucky to be managing the wrong project at the right time. Lucky to be working for two tough bosses—one who forced you into an impossible situation and one who forced you to talk to that Lally fellow who helped you dig yourself out."

Steve blanched.

"You asked." Hal shrugged. "To be fair, you did perform well under pressure."

Then the tennis match started. Eleanor and Hal were the players, Steve was the ball, spinning backwards and forwards as they talked.

Eleanor served first. "Actually, Steven, that is Hal's way of saying thank you. We both agree you did a splendid job. And..."—she leaned forward and glared at Hal—"we have a favor to ask of you."

"I have some new information for you," Hal said. "Then you have a choice to make."

He surveyed the room, checking no one could overhear.

"Let's start with what you already know. One, we made a huge bet when we invested in Future Perfect. Two, it was supposed to resuscitate Wyx-Fin. Three, it might still do that, but we won't know how well it sells until the new financial year.

"Now, here's what you don't know: When Group agreed to this bet, they made it clear that if Future Perfect is not a significant commercial success, we get sold to the highest bidder."

Steve wasn't surprised. He'd suspected as much.

"So when Chaste came along, they blew our business case out of the water. My bosses, figuring the bet was bust, wanted to put Wyx-Fin on the chopping block. I persuaded them to make another, smaller bet."

"You bet we could deliver impossibly early."

Hal nodded.

"That bet seems to have paid off."

"Correct. We're not currently on the auction block. But the bigger bet hasn't paid off yet. If Future Perfect doesn't sell exceptionally well between April and August next year, Wyx-Fin still gets sold."

Steve sucked in a sharp breath.

If Wyx-Fin was sold, it would probably go to a competitor. They'd pay more because they could eliminate duplicated staff. Steve would be out of a job almost immediately. Over time, so would most of his people.

Eleanor said, "But as grim as that sounds, Future Perfect is live."

Steve let that sink in. They'd done it. December 1st was still two weeks away, and they were already selling.

"Your defect rate is extremely low," Eleanor continued, "so your team will spend their time making genuine improvements rather than fixing bugs. Nine months is a surprisingly long time."

Hal cleared his throat. "Which brings us to your choice."

"My choice?"

Eleanor sighed. "Now that FPP is live, Norbert wants you, come January, to work full-time for him in a new job—helping others across the Group invert their projects. Initially rescuing in-flight projects, then figuring out how to invert new projects from the start. It will require more travel, but you seem to like that."

Steve's mouth fell open. Apart from the travel, that was the job of his dreams. High-profile, visibility across the Group, the potential to have a real and positive impact. It wasn't the job he'd been aspiring to—it was better.

"We'd prefer you stay," Eleanor said. Her serious tone made him wary.

"HR informs me I can't force you to stay," she continued. "But Norbert won't force you to take the job either, since you have a young family. The transfer isn't mandatory."

Hal started his sales pitch. "You shouldn't think of staying as just helping Future Perfect. Think of it as possibly preventing the sale of the company—and more importantly, saving your staff and your friends' jobs. We're the only major employer of computer people in Watt's Bridge."

Eleanor rested her hand on top of Steve's. "We need your decision by Wednesday."

She and Hal stood to leave.

"Wait," Steve said.

They stopped.

"Sit."

They sat.

## The Top-Right Corner

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve remembers Craig's 2x2 grid—and realizes he doesn't have to choose between the dream job and his family. He calls Norbert and negotiates his way into both jobs. "Congratulations, Steve. You just negotiated your way into both jobs."*

Steve closed his eyes and let his head fall back toward the ceiling.

They weren't telling him everything. They were in the middle of a negotiation—selling him on staying by emphasizing the pros and downplaying the cons, while doing the opposite for leaving. If Norbert were there, he'd do exactly the same from his perspective.

And then Steve did something he'd never done before.

Silently, he squeezed his right hand. On the one hand, he could take the new job—an awesome and influential role.

He squeezed his left hand. On the other hand, he could stay—possibly saving his friends' jobs, and for nine months avoiding increased travel, spending more time with his family.

He tipped his head slightly. The overarching need was his and his family's happiness.

He was torn between his own personal ambitions and the happiness of his friends and family. This choice wasn't just about him.

His own philosophy—that if you're jet-lagged you might as well be eating bacon—did nothing for his mum or his kids, who bore the brunt of his travel.

He was sick of the travel. Bacon can't solve every problem.

Or can it?

Pigs don't just make good bacon. They also make good gifts—if you have a nice ribbon and know how to wrap it.

Steve opened his eyes. The new job's pig was clearly the increased travel. But what was the value of being "important" if his family suffered?

He smiled. He had the pig, and in that instant he figured out the ribbon. Now all he had to do was the wrapping.

He thought of Craig's napkin sketch—the 2x2 grid. Everyone assumed you had to choose between high quality and fast, or fast and shoddy. But there was a third option: both. The top-right corner.

The same logic applied here. Everyone assumed he had to choose between the dream job with travel, or staying put for his family. But what if he could have both?

"We're only talking about nine months? And we're negotiating right now, correct?"

Hal and Eleanor both agreed. Eleanor was smiling hopefully; Hal was doing his best to look neutral.

"Good." Steve pulled out his mobile and dialed Norbert's number. He switched it to speaker mode and rested it on the seat between them.

"Hello, Steve. How did your launch go?"

"Great. We need to talk. I've got Eleanor and Hal here with me."

"Ah. They've made you the offer?"

"They have. And I've got a counter-proposal that I think works for everyone."

Steve laid it out. He'd stay in Watt's Bridge for the nine months, making Future Perfect a success. His team would use Wyx-Fin as a laboratory—figuring out how to invert projects from the start, not just rescue failing ones. That knowledge would be valuable to the whole Group.

"And after August?" Norbert asked.

"Assuming Future Perfect succeeds—and I'm betting my career on it—you'll want me to teach others across the Group how to do this. But instead of me flying to them, they fly to me. I stay based here, in Watt's Bridge."

The line went quiet for a moment.

"That's... actually quite clever," Norbert said. "Eleanor? Hal?"

Eleanor nodded slowly. Hal raised an eyebrow, then shrugged. "Works for me."

"Then we have a deal," Norbert said. "Congratulations, Steve. You just negotiated your way into both jobs."

## Fran Would Be Proud

> [!abstract] Chapter Summary
> *Steve wakes hungover after celebrating. Alison watches Scooby-Doo, his mum makes bacon, and he texts Craig the good news. Best of all: more time at home. "Fran would be proud of you."*

The following morning, Steve woke late, instantly regretting he'd agreed to join Phil and Gregor and Vrinda and Tim for "just one pint" after FPP's disco.

Just one! Was there actually such a thing?

They'd started with Guinness at The Burns Unit, then ambled down to High Street for an Indian, washing it down with Kingfisher. Then black Russians before calling it an evening. He got a cab home sometime between midnight and sunrise.

Alison was in the lounge watching cartoons under a den made of dining chairs and rugs. She rushed over for a hug. Steve crouched down—with difficulty—and told her he'd trade for a kiss. She leaned in and then, with the brutal honesty only a four-year-old can command, said, "Your breath stinks, Daddy."

He kissed her anyway, then tickled her to change the subject. "What are you watching?"

"Scooby-Doo."

"I've seen this one. Is this the one where, right at the end, they discover the monster isn't really a monster—it's just someone dressed up?"

She scrunched up her little nose. "They're *all* like that, Dad."

He went through to the kitchen. Mum was doing the crossword.

She took one look at him, said, "My poor boy," and started preparing a bacon sandwich, whether he wanted one or not.

While the bacon sizzled, she said, "You're far too old for these late nights."

Steve pulled out his phone and typed a quick text to Craig: *Great news. We're gonna hit December 1st. Guaranteed. But I need more of your help—I've kinda gone and got myself a bigger job. Talk soon?*

He hit send and smiled. Craig would appreciate that.

"I got a promotion yesterday," Steve said, grinning despite himself.

She smiled. "So you were celebrating?"

"Yesterday was maybe the best day of my career ever, Mum!"

"Do tell."

So he told. He stood in the doorway of his tiny kitchen and told her the story while she turned the bacon and nodded in all the right places.

She popped the sandwiches on a plate and said, "Does this mean your travel is going to increase?"

"No."

"But you'll have to travel after next summer?"

"No."

"No travel?" She looked confused. "Tell me then, clever clogs, how did you manage to get this promotion without the travel?"

Steve picked up his sandwich and took a tentative bite. The butter and the salt, the soft bread and the crunch of the bacon, mixed with the ketchup's sharp sweetness were, at that moment, the best thing that had ever happened to him.

"Mmmm. This is so good."

"Steven?"

He put the sandwich down and smiled. "I brokered a deal between Norbert, Eleanor and Hal. I'll stay in Watt's Bridge, doing my utmost to ensure Future Perfect is a commercial success. My team and I will use Wyx-Fin to figure out how to invert projects from the start. That's good for us and for the Group."

She nodded. "It's good provided Future Perfect succeeds—but that isn't guaranteed."

"Future Perfect is my number one priority. But assuming it goes well, Norbert wants me to teach people in his other subsidiaries how to invert their projects. When that happens, I've told him they can fork out for the airfares and fly to *me*. He's very happy with that."

She clapped her hands together. "Wonderful! Hal and Eleanor get what they want. You get the job you've always wanted. Norbert gets what he wants."

Steve looked out the window and noticed Ashley and Alison playing together in the back yard. He watched them for a moment, then took another bite of his sandwich. He really did love the taste of bacon—but if he ever had to, he thought he could live without it.

"And best of all," he said, "I get to spend more time at home, with you and the kids."

Mum looked down at her hands, then back up at him.

"Fran would be proud of you."

That was the best thing anyone could ever say to him.

**THE END**
