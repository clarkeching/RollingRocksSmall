# Act 1: SETUP (Chapters 1-21)
## "The Impossible Deadline"

---

### Chapter 1: The Bad News
**Thursday, August 3rd**

Steve Abernethy is jet-lagged, sitting in Luca's café at 5:26 AM—his three-step jet lag recovery routine (espresso, bacon, work). His best friend **[[Phil McDermott|Phil McDermott]]** calls, hungover and urgent. Phil shuffles in looking like "a bald, malnourished version of Paul McCartney" reeking of stale cigarettes.

The news: At a pre-wedding pub session, **Pauline**—their former lead analyst who supposedly moved to Birmingham to care for her sick mother-in-law—drunkenly confessed the truth. She was poached by **Chaste Group** to build a no-frills version of FPP. And Chaste is launching **April 1st**—the same date Wyx-Fin was planning.

The kicker: Pauline doesn't know FPP is running late. Chaste will beat them to market.

*"She was a friend,"* Phil says sadly.

---

### Chapter 2: The Call to Eleanor

Steve goes to his office at 6:05 AM. His sea view is blocked by a parking garage. He reviews the project status reports—there are two versions. The public one says April 1st is "aggressive but achievable." The management-eyes-only version says they're tracking toward **October or November**.

He calls **[[Eleanor Scharlau|Eleanor Scharlau]]**, the CFO. She's all business, no small talk. She tells him to come up at noon.

---

### Chapter 3: February 1st

Steve meets Eleanor in her penthouse office. **[[Halifax Gibbet|Halifax Gibbet]]** (Hal)—the CEO, "five foot six inches tall and round"—storms out barking "No more excuses!"

Eleanor delivers the blow: Hal has promised Group they'll beat Chaste. The new launch date is **February 1st**—not April.

Steve protests: *"He's robbed us of two months. He can't do that."*

Eleanor, coldly: *"He can, and—in fact—he just has."*

Steve asks about Plan B. Eleanor hints darkly at "or else" consequences. Steve figures it out: Hal's job is on the line. FPP is his "get-out-of-jail-free card."

---

### Chapter 4: Steve's Personal Circumstances

Steve calls his **mum** to say he'll be late home. Here we learn: Steve is a widower. His wife **Fran** died of a brain aneurysm two-and-a-half years earlier while they were vacationing in Rome. His mum moved in to help raise **Ashley** (7) and **Alison** (4).

*"My poor boy,"* his mum says.

Steve stares out the window at the rain. *"Drip. Drip. Drip. Gravity sucks."*

---

### Chapter 5: Craig Lally (First Mention)

Steve calls **[[Norbert Billings|Norbert Billings]]**, the Group CIO (his dotted-line boss, based in Malmö). Norbert pushes Steve—again—to contact **[[Craig Lally|Craig Lally]]**, a TCQ consultant upstairs. Steve has been avoiding Craig because he helped Wyxcomb Health "outsource" their development team.

Steve looks up Craig in the directory. His job title is "Flow Master." His resume is full of buzzwords: Lean, Six Sigma, TOC. His full name is Alistair Craig Lally.

Steve reluctantly calls Craig. Craig is chirpy. Steve is suspicious. Craig explains what really happened at Wyx-Health: they chose to buy a software package because their old system was a "broken old camel" and building a replacement would have taken 12-24 months. Buying took 3 months and paid for itself within 3 months of launch.

Steve grudgingly agrees to meet for brunch the following Tuesday.

---

### Chapter 6: The FPP Team Meeting

Steve arrives early to the weekly FPP management meeting. He describes the conference room palm tree and jokes about hiding behind it to surprise people.

**[[Gregor|Gregor]]** arrives—FPP's project manager. "Big, scary-looking, barrel-chested with a military-style haircut." Office rumor: he sleeps with the lights on, not because he's scared of the dark, but because the dark is scared of him.

The team gathers: **[[Vrinda|Vrinda]]** (lead analyst, Steve's old friend, doesn't mince words), **[[Tim_Phillips|Tim Phillips]]** (testing manager), **[[Catherine MacDonald|Catherine MacDonald]]** (customer rep, "petite with long, deliberately wild, red hair").

Gregor drones through the Gantt chart. Vrinda challenges him about low-priority features taking up senior developer time. Gregor shuts her down: *"The project doesn't finish until they're finished. End of story."*

---

### Chapter 7: The Announcement

Steve drops the bomb: Chaste stole Pauline. The new launch date is February 1st.

Vrinda explodes: *"Another arbitrary date imposed on us from on high!"*

Catherine, slower to react, looks betrayed. *"Pauline really did this?"*

Steve gives them their marching orders: War Room for 24+ hours. Deliver a recovery plan by 4pm tomorrow. Four things to remember:
1. Complete, saleable product by February 1st
2. Cut the product drastically
3. FPP is priority #1—obstacles will be removed
4. Quality is negotiable (to a point). *"This baby will be born premature."*

---

### Chapter 8: Craig Calls (Ignored)

Steve returns to his desk exhausted but pleased. There's a sticky note: Craig Lally called. URGENT.

Steve crumples it up and throws it in the trash.

---

### Chapter 9: Home

Steve comes home to his fairy-tale gatehouse built into old defensive walls. The kids are watching Scooby-Doo. Alison rushes over for a hug. Steve asks her what she's watching.

*"I've seen this one before. Is this the one where, right at the end, they discover the monster isn't really a monster, it's just someone dressed up like a monster?"*

She scrunches her nose: *"Yeaah. They're all like that, Dad."*

He gives the girls their tacky Singapore gifts. *"It felt good to be properly home."*

---

### Chapter 10: The Recovery Plan
**Friday, August 4th**

Steve returns to the War Room at 3:55pm. Walls covered with sticky notes. Pizza boxes. It smells like work.

Gregor presents the triage. They used a sticky-note prioritization method, force-ranking every feature against a "pivot" feature—more valuable to the left, less to the right. Catherine decided where the "bare minimum" line was (marked with a big pink sticky).

The devastating news: **They've descoped the web app entirely.**

Steve: *"Seriously? We're launching without a web app? People will laugh."*

Catherine: *"We will look lame, but most sales will come from branches and call centers."*

Gregor is confident: *"Aggressive but achievable."* He'll announce compulsory overtime and ask everyone to cancel vacations.

Vrinda snaps at him. Steve intervenes: *"If you two kids can't play nicely together then I'll send you to your rooms."*

---

### Chapter 11: Vrinda's Warning

Steve walks Vrinda to his office for a private chat. She unloads: Gregor is "an arse." No one trusts him.

Then she drops the bomb: *"For months, he's been lying about the health of the project."*

Steve sighs and reveals the truth: *"Gregor didn't lie to me or the steering group. April was always an aggressive date."*

Vrinda is stunned: *"You knew we'd run late?"*

Steve explains the game: keep the pressure on, otherwise scope expands until it's too big to deliver.

Vrinda's parting shot: *"I never said he's an ogre. I said he's an arse, and I implied this project is going to crash and burn."*

---

### Chapter 12: Ron McKnight's Three Lists
**Monday, August 7th**

Steve announces the new plan at a team meeting. He meets **[[Ron McKnight|Ron McKnight]]**, his support and maintenance manager—"grey-haired, curmudgeonly, a mix of gruff, grumpy, dour."

Ron has his legendary **[[Three_List_System|three-list system]]** in a battered ring-binder:
- List #1: Requests not yet started (long)
- List #2: Currently being worked on (thin)
- List #3: Finished requests (ever-growing)

Ron agrees to bump some CORETRAN work to make room for FPP bug-fixing.

Steve meets **[[Declan McGuiness|Declan McGuiness]]**, the employee rep. Steve also meets with Eleanor, Mark, and Catherine. Gregor speaks with confidence. Mark offers to buy them a pint.

*"All in all, it was a good day. We were back on track. For now."*

---

### Chapter 13: Meeting Craig
**Tuesday, August 8th**

Steve meets Craig at 9:55 AM in the cafeteria. Craig is "late-50s, tieless, looks like a man who'd climbed a lot of mountains—for pleasure—and drove to the mountains in a twenty-year-old Volvo he maintained himself."

Craig asks about Steve's background (19 years with Wyxcomb, widower, transferred to Watt's Bridge after Fran's death).

Then Craig introduces **[[Evaporating Cloud|the Evaporating Cloud]]**—a five-box thinking tool. The boxes: two "hands" (D and D') representing conflicting choices, two "shoulders" (B and C) representing needs/concerns, and one "head" (A) representing the common goal.

Craig walks Steve through the Wyx-Health buy vs. build cloud as an example.

---

### Chapter 14: Steve Draws His Cloud

Steve draws his own cloud for FPP:
- **D (hand):** Ship poor quality product on Feb 1st
- **D' (other hand):** Ship good quality with adequate features
- **C (shoulder):** Product that sells well and makes us proud
- **B (other shoulder):** Deliver according to Hal's schedule
- **A (head/goal):** FPP is successful both long and short term

Steve writes it out and feels calm. *"I saw the enemy. It wasn't Chaste. It wasn't Hal or Eleanor."*

Craig nods: *"That's why we draw it."*

---

### Chapter 15: "Isn't This Obvious?"

Steve reads the cloud back to himself several times. It starts to feel... familiar. Old. Obvious.

*"Isn't all this obvious?"* Steve asks, annoyed.

Craig: *"Is it? Good. That probably means it's correct."*

Craig explains this is a common conflict. Most people think quality and speed are opposites. But: *"Quality, done right, increases speed and productivity."*

Craig admits he probably can't fix FPP—it's too far along. But he can help prevent the *next* FPP.

---

### Chapter 16: The Cafeteria

Craig takes Steve into the Wyx-Fin cafeteria kitchen to meet **[[Cheryl|Cheryl]]**—a thin, short, middle-aged woman who's worked there 28 years.

Craig explains: Three years ago, the cafeteria food was "barely fit for human consumption." They were about to be outsourced. Craig helped them turn it around.

Two problems: The **[[Dog Food Problem|Dog Food Problem]]** (bad quality) and the **[[French Fry Revelation|French Fry Revelation]]** (flow/forecasting).

---

### Chapter 17: Eating Your Own Dog Food

Cheryl tells the story: Her old boss told Craig to "go screw himself" when he said the food was horrible. She didn't come back. Cheryl got her job.

Craig's condition: They had to **eat the same food they served customers.**

The first revelation: *"No one ever tasted it before serving it."*

They followed "foolproof" recipes but never checked if the food was actually good. Once they started tasting—and fixing—the food quality transformed in two weeks.

Craig calls this moving from **[[Late_Inspection|late inspection]]** (testing at the end) to **[[In_Process_Inspection|in-process inspection]]** (building quality in as you go).

---

### Chapter 18: Steve Pushes Back

Steve gets defensive: *"My staff already does extensive in-process inspections. We inspect requirements, design documents, code..."*

Craig asks: *"Are you inspecting—looking—at words and code, or testing—tasting—that the software acts as you expect?"*

Steve admits they do both. But then spend 30%+ of every project in the testing phase—testing AND reworking.

Cheryl whistles: *"You spend thirty percent of your time fixing broken stuff?"*

Steve decides he doesn't like her. He asks to speak with Craig privately and leaves.

Craig sighs: *"Let's go talk."*

---

### Chapter 19: The Shit Hits the Fan
**Wednesday, August 16th**

Precisely 2:22 PM. Eleanor storms onto Steve's floor: *"Where the hell is your staff? The FPP area is deserted!"*

A contractor snitched. The permanent staff is at the pub. **The Burns Unit.**

Eleanor delivers a message from Hal: *"Launch FPP on time. Or find a new job."*

She slams Steve's door hard enough to rattle the glass.

---

### Chapter 20: The Mutiny

Steve finds his team at the pub. ABBA's "Dancing Queen" is playing. About 40 people are drinking. Phil and Vrinda are there. So is **Declan** the employee rep.

Vrinda confronts Steve: Gregor cancelled everyone's holidays—again. Told people to work more overtime. *"I have children. He can shove it."*

Phil: *"None of us believe we'll make February 1st. And none of us believed we'd make the original date either."*

Steve takes a gamble. He tells Phil and Vrinda—in confidence—that **Hal has threatened his job.**

Vrinda makes a deal: She'll get them back to work. But no compulsory overtime. And they need to descope even more.

*"There is always more room to descope. Always."*

The team drains their drinks and shuffles back to work. None make eye contact with Steve.

---

### Chapter 21: Hal Burns His Boats

Steve walks out of the pub into the sunlight. Declan is outside sucking on a plastic cigar (nicotine replacement).

They walk back to the office. Steve promises: no forced overtime, vacations un-cancelled.

At the staff entrance, Declan rushes back: *"The lads just told me—Chaste announced they're launching February 1st."*

And worse: **Hal just issued a press release announcing Wyx-Fin is launching December 1st.**

December 1st. Two more months stolen.

Steve decides to go upstairs and tell Hal "precisely what an arsehole he was."

---

## 😲 PIVOT: Hal has burned his boats. There's no going back.

> *"Hal had just declared war on Chaste. And I and my team were the collateral damage."*
