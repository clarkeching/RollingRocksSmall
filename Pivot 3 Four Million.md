# 😲 Pivot Point: Eleanor Reveals £4 Million

**End of Act 2b → Start of Act 3**

---

## What Happens

After the Mutiny is resolved, Eleanor calls Steve. She asks him a question he hasn't considered: what are the *financial* implications of delivering early?

Steve does the maths: eight months of unexpected sales, at half a million pounds each month, equals four million pounds.

> "I, with some help, had just made a significant contribution to the Group's finances."

## Why It Matters

Up until now, Steve has been focused on *survival* - just hitting the deadline. This moment reframes everything:

- This isn't just about surviving
- They've created massive financial value
- Steve has leverage he didn't know he had
- The method works - and it's worth money

The seagull poops on him anyway (Hal takes credit), but Steve now knows the truth: FPP is where the money's at.

## The Shift

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Fighting to survive | Creating value |
| Hoping to meet deadline | Already winning |
| No leverage | Holds cards |
| "Will we make it?" | "What else can we do?" |

## The Numbers

- 8 months early selling
- £500,000 per month average
- = **£4 million** extra cash
